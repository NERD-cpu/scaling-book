======= The bidomain model in electrophysiology =======
label{scale:bidomain}

The mechanical functioning of the heart is crucially dependent on
correct electric signal propagation through the heart tissue.
A widely used mathematical
model for the electric signal propagation is the bidomain equations:
!bt
\begin{align}
\chi C_m\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &=
\nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot (\sigma_i\nabla u_e) - \chi I_{\rm{ion}}
- \chi I_{\rm{app}},
label{scale:bidomain:eqv}\\
0 &= \nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot ((\sigma_i + \sigma_e)\nabla u_e)\tp
label{scale:bidomain:equ_e}
\end{align}
!et
These PDEs are posed in a spatial domain $H$ for $t\in (0, T]$. The symbols in these PDEs have the following meaning:
$u_e$ is the extracellular electric potential,
$v$ is the transmembrane potential (difference between the extracellular
and intracellular potential),
$C_m$ is the capacitance of the cell membrane,
$\chi$ is a membrane area to cell volume ratio,
$\sigma_i$ is a electric conductivity tensor for the intracellular space, and
$\sigma_e$ is a electric conductivity tensor for the extracellular space.

The boundary conditions are of Neumann type, and we drop these from the discussion.
The initial condition is typically $u_e=0, v = v_r$, where
$v_{r}$ is a constant resting potential.

The PDE system is driven by $I_{\rm{ion}} + I_{\rm{app}}$, where
$I_{\rm{ion}}$ is a reaction term describing ionic currents across the
cell membrane, and $ I_{\rm{app}}$ is an externally applied stimulus
current. The applied current is normally a prescribed function,
typically piecewise constant in time and space, while
$I_{\rm{ion}} = I_{\rm{ion}}(v,s)$, where $s$ is a state vector
describing the electro-chemical state of the cells. Typical components
of $s$ are intracellular ionic concentrations and so-called gate variables that
describe the permeability of the cell membrane, and its dynamics is
governed governed by a system of ODEs, see for instance cite{Sundnes_2006} for
details. The total
current $I_{\rm{ion}}$ is normally written as a sum of individual
ionic currents:

!bt
\[ I_{\rm{ion}}(s,v) = \sum_{j=1}^n I_{j}(s,v), \]
!et
where $n$ is typically between 10 and 20 in recent models of cardiac
cells. Most of the individual currents will be on the form
$ I_{j}(s,v) = g_j(s)(v-v_j), $
where $v_j$ is the equlibrium potential of the specific ion, and
$g_j(s)$ describes the membrane conductance to a specific ion. Without
much loss of generality we can assume that this formulation is valid
for all $I_{j}$, and the total ionic current can then be written in the
general form

!bt
\[
I_{\rm{ion}}(s,v) = \sum_{j=1}^n I_{\rm{j}}(s,v) = g(s)(v-v_{eq}(s)) ,
\]
!et
where $g(s) = \sum_{j=1}^n g_j(s)$ and $v_{eq}(s) = (\sum_{j=1}^n g_j
v_j)/\sum_{j=1}^n g_j$.
As noted above, the dynamics of $s$ is governed by an ODE system on
the form
!bt
\[
\frac{ds}{dt} = f(v,s) \tp
\]
!et
The time scales of individual components of $s$ typically vary
greatly, making any scaling of this system highly dependent on the
component under study. For the present text, the focus is on
tissue-level electrophysiology as described by
(ref{scale:bidomain:eqv})-(ref{scale:bidomain:equ_e}), and we will proceed
to scale these equations. The bidomain model is a system of
reaction-diffusion type, and the scaling will be based on the general
non-linear reaction-diffusion equation in Section ref{sec:scale:diffu:homo1D}.

Dimensionless independent variables are introduced by

!bt
\[ \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad
\bar y = \frac{y}{L},\quad \bar z = \frac{z}{L},\quad
\bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},\]
!et
where $L$ is the characteristic length scale, and $t_c$ is the
characteristic time scale. Dimensionless dependent variables are
expressed as

!bt
\[ \bar v = \frac{v-v_r}{v_p-v_r},\quad \bar u = \frac{u_e}{u_c} \tp\]
!et
As noted above, $v_r$ is the resting potential, and $v_p$ is the peak potential.
The scaling of $v$ ensures $\bar v\in [0,1]$. We introduce the symbol
$\Delta v = v_p-v_r$ to save space in the formulas: $\bar v = (v-v_r)/\Delta v$.
The scale for $u_e$ is $u_c$, to be
determined either from simplicity of the equations or from available analysis of
its magnitude.

The variable tensor coefficients $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_e$ depend on the spatial
coordinates and are also scaled:
!bt
\[ \bar \sigma_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_c},\quad \bar \sigma_e = \frac{\sigma_e}{\sigma_c}\tp\]
!et
For simplicity, we have chosen a common scale $\sigma_c$, but the two tensors
may employ difference scales, and we may also choose different scales
for different directions, to reflect the anisotropic conductivity of
the tissue. One typically chooses $\sigma_c$ as a norm of
$\sigma_i + \sigma_e$, e.g., the maximum value.

Finally, we introduce a scaling of the parameters entering the ionic
current term

!bt
\[ \bar v_{eq} = (v_{eq}-v_r)/\Delta v,\quad\bar g = g/g_c\tp\]
!et
For the characteristic membrane conductance a common choice is
$g_c = 1/R_m$, where $R_m$ is the membrane resistance at
rest, but we will instead set $g_c = g_{\max}$, the maximum conductance
of the membrane. These choices will ensure $\bar v_{eq}, \bar g \in
[0,1]$.


Inserting the dimensionless variables in the equations, the system
of governing equations becomes

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta v}{t_c}\chi C_m\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\frac{\sigma_c u_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\
&\quad - \chi g_c \Delta v \bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s)) -\chi I_{\rm{app}},
\\
0 &= \frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) + \frac{\sigma_cu_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\
\end{align*}
!et
Multiplying the equations by appropriate factors leads to equations with
dimensionless terms only:
!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\frac{t_c\sigma_c}{\chi C_mL^2}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\frac{t_c\sigma_c u_c}{\Delta v \chi C_mL^2}\nabla\cdot (\bar
\sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) - \\
&\quad
\frac{g_c t_c}{C_m} \bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s))
- \frac{t_c}{C_m\Delta v} I_{\rm{app}},\\
0 &= \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) + \frac{u_c}{\Delta v}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\
\end{align*}
!et

The time scale is not so obvious to choose. As noted above, the ODE
system that governs $s$ and thereby $\bar g(s), \bar v_{eq} (s)$ may
feature a wide range of spatial scales. Furthermore, even if we focus
on the tissue equations and focus on the dynamics of $v$ and $u_e$,
the bidomain equations are characterized by relatively small regions
having large spatial and temporal gradients, while in most of the
domain variations are slower. The PDEs are of reaction-diffusion
nature, and the solution takes the form of a wavefront of activation
that propagates through the tissue. For now we choose the time scale
based on balancing the reaction and diffusion components.  From
previous examples in Section ref{sec:scale:diffu:homo1D}, we therefore
set the terms in front of the reaction term and the diffusion term to
unity.  This idea means

!bt
\[ \frac{t_c\sigma_c}{\chi C_mL^2} = 1,\quad \frac{t_cg_c}{C_m} =1,\]
!et
which determines the time and length scales:

!bt
\[ t_c = \frac{C_m}{g_c},\quad L = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c}{g_c \chi}}\tp\]
!et

Two natural dimensionless variables then arise from the second diffusion
term and the applied current term:
!bt
\[ \alpha = \frac{u_c}{\Delta v}, \quad \beta =
\frac{I_{\rm{app}}}{g_c \Delta v} \tp\]
!et
In many cases it will be natural to set $u_c=\Delta v$, which of
course removes the need for $\alpha$, but we
include the freedom to have $u_c$ as
some specified characteristic size of $u_e$.

The final dimensionless system becomes
!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\alpha\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) \\
& \quad -\bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s))
- \beta
\\
0 &= \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) +
\alpha\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u) \tp
\end{align}
!et
The two dimensionless variables in these equations have
straightforward
interpretations: $\alpha$ is the ratio of the span in the two electric
potentials, and $\beta$ is ratio of the source term with $I_{\rm{app}}$ and the
time-derivative term of $v$, or the source term and the diffusion term
in $v$.

[js: preliminary notes]
We can insert typical values for the parameters to get a feel for the
chosen scaling. We have

!bt
\begin{align*}
C_m &= 1.0\, \mu\hbox{F\,cm}^{-2}, \quad g_c = g_{max} = 13.0
\hbox{m\,S}\mu\hbox{F}^{-1} = 13.0 \hbox{mS\,cm}^{-2}, \\
\chi &= 2000 \hbox{cm}^{-1} , \quad u_c = \Delta v = 100 \hbox{mV} , \\
\sigma_c &= 3.0 \hbox{mS\,cm}^{-1}\tp
\end{align*}
!et

This gives the following values of $t_c$ and $L$:
!bt
\begin{align*} t_c &= \frac{1.0 \mu\hbox{F\,cm}^{-2}}{13.0 \mu\hbox{F\,cm}^{-2}} =
\frac{1.0}{13.0}\frac{\mu\hbox{F}}{\hbox{mS}} \approx 0.076 \hbox{ms} \\
L &= \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c}{\chi g_c}} = \sqrt{\frac{3.0
\hbox{mS\,cm}^{-2}}{2000\hbox{cm}^{-1} \mu\hbox{F\,cm}^-2}}
\approx 0.087 \hbox{mm} \tp
\end{align*}
!et
These values are both very small, which is probably related to our
choice of $g_c = g_{\max}$. This implies that we choose the appropriate
scaling based on the upstroke phase of the action potential, when both
spatial and temporal variations are extremely high. This may therefore
be a ``correct'' scaling exactly at the wavefront of the electrical
potential, but seems less relevant elsewhere. Choosing $g_c$ to be for
instance the resting conductance, which is the common choice when
scaling the cable equation, may increase $t_c, L$ by factors up to 2500 and
50, respectively.

[hpl: Joakim, can you say something about the relevance of these scales? A factor of 2500 is quite big...]

The conduction velocity is often a quantity of interest, and we could
obtain an alternative relation between $t_c$ and $L$ by requiring
$v_{c} = L/t_c$. In human cardiac tissue $v_c$ is known to be about
60 cm/s, while the choices above gives

!bt
\[
\frac{L}{t_c} =  \frac{0.087\rm{mm}}{0.076\rm{ms}} \approx 144
\hbox{cm/s}\tp \]
!et
Enforcing $L/t_c = 60 \hbox{cm\,s}^-1$ gives the constraint $g_c \approx
4.8 \hbox{mS\,cm}^{-2}$, and yields $L \approx 0.17$ mm and
$t_c=0.21$ ms. These are still small values, but very close to the
standard values of $\Delta x, \Delta t$ required for accurate
numerical solution. That is, this choice of scaling will give $\Delta x
\approx \Delta t \approx 1$, instead of $\bar t, \bar x \approx 1$?

[hpl: That sounds a big strange, but if the focus is on a smaller scale,
choosing $L$ and $t_c$ from this scale leads to that conclusion.]
