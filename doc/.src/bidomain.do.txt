======= The bidomain model in electrophysiology =======
label{scale:bidomain}

The mechanical functioning of the heart is crucially dependent on
correct electric signal propagation through the heart tissue.
A widely used mathematical
model for the electric signal propagation is the bidomain equations:
!bt
\begin{align}
\chi C_m\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &=
\nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot (\sigma_i\nabla u_e) - \chi I_{\rm{ion}}
- \chi I_{\rm{app}},
label{scale:bidomain:eqv}\\
0 &= \nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot ((\sigma_i + \sigma_e)\nabla u_e)\tp
label{scale:bidomain:equ_e}
\end{align}
!et
These PDEs are posed in a spatial domain $H$ for $t\in (0, T]$, and the symbols have the following meaning:
$u_e$ is the extracellular electric potential,
$v$ is the transmembrane potential (difference between the extracellular
and intracellular potential),
$C_m$ is the capacitance of the cell membrane,
$\chi$ is a membrane area to cell volume ratio,
$\sigma_i$ is an electric conductivity tensor for the intracellular space, and
$\sigma_e$ is an electric conductivity tensor for the extracellular space.

The boundary conditions are of Neumann type, and we drop these from the discussion.
The initial condition is typically $u_e=0, v = v_r$, where
$v_{r}$ is a constant resting potential.

The PDE system is driven by $I_{\rm{ion}} + I_{\rm{app}}$, where
$I_{\rm{ion}}$ is a reaction term describing ionic currents across the
cell membrane, and $ I_{\rm{app}}$ is an externally applied stimulus
current. The applied current is a prescribed function,
typically piecewise constant in time and space, while
$I_{\rm{ion}} = I_{\rm{ion}}(v,s)$, where $s$ is a state vector
describing the electro-chemical state of the cells. Typical components
of $s$ are intracellular ionic concentrations and so-called gate variables that
describe the permeability of the cell membrane. The dynamics of $s$ is
governed by a system of ODEs, see for instance cite{Sundnes_2006} for
details. The total
current $I_{\rm{ion}}$ is often written as a sum of individual
ionic currents:
!bt
\begin{align} I_{\rm{ion}}(s,v) &= \sum_{j=1}^n I_{j}(s,v), 
label{scale:bidomain:ion1}
\end{align}
!et
where $n$ is typically between 10 and 20 in recent models of cardiac
cells. Most of the individual currents will be on the form
$ I_{j}(s,v) = g_j(s)(v-v_j), $
where $v_j$ is the equilibrium potential of the specific ion, and
$g_j(s)$ describes the membrane conductance of the particular ion channel. Without
much loss of generality we can assume that this formulation is valid
for all $I_{j}$, and the total ionic current can then be written in the
general form
!bt
\[
I_{\rm{ion}}(s,v) = \sum_{j=1}^n I_{j}(s,v) = g(s)(v-v_{eq}(s)) ,
\]
!et
where $g(s) = \sum_{j=1}^n g_j(s)$ and $v_{eq}(s) = (\sum_{j=1}^n g_j
v_j)/(\sum_{j=1}^n g_j)$.

As noted above, the dynamics of $s$ is governed by an ODE system on
the form
!bt
\[
\frac{ds}{dt} = f(v,s) \tp
\]
!et
and the individual components of $s$ typically have very
different time scales, making any scaling of this system highly dependent on the
component under study. For the present text, the focus is on
tissue-level electrophysiology as described by
(ref{scale:bidomain:eqv})-(ref{scale:bidomain:equ_e}), and we will proceed
to scale these equations. The equations are of
reaction-diffusion type, and the scaling will be based on the general
non-linear reaction-diffusion equation in Section ref{sec:scale:diffu:homo1D}.

Dimensionless independent variables are introduced by
!bt
\[ \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad
\bar y = \frac{y}{L},\quad \bar z = \frac{z}{L},\quad
\bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},\]
!et
where $L$ is the characteristic length scale, and $t_c$ is the
characteristic time scale. Dimensionless dependent variables are
expressed as

!bt
\[ \bar v = \frac{v-v_r}{v_p-v_r},\quad \bar u = \frac{u_e}{u_c} \tp\]
!et
As noted above, $v_r$ is the resting potential, and $v_p$ is the peak
transmembrane potential.
The scaling of $v$ ensures $\bar v\in [0,1]$. We introduce the symbol
$\Delta v = v_p-v_r$ to save space in the formulas: $\bar v = (v-v_r)/\Delta v$.
The scale for $u_e$ is $u_c$, to be
determined either from simplicity of the equations or from available analysis of
its magnitude.

The variable tensor coefficients $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_e$ depend on the spatial
coordinates and are also scaled:
!bt
\[ \bar \sigma_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_c},\quad \bar \sigma_e = \frac{\sigma_e}{\sigma_c}\tp\]
!et
For simplicity, we have chosen a common scale $\sigma_c$, but the two tensors
may employ different scales, and we may also choose different scales
for different directions, to reflect the anisotropic conductivity of
the tissue. A typical choice of $\sigma_c$ is a norm of
$\sigma_i + \sigma_e$, e.g., the maximum value.

Finally, we introduce a scaling of the parameters entering the ionic
current term

!bt
\[ \bar v_{eq} = (v_{eq}-v_r)/\Delta v,\quad\bar g = g/g_c\tp\]
!et
For the characteristic membrane conductance, $g_c$,  a common choice is
$g_c = 1/R_m$, where $R_m$ is the membrane resistance at
rest, but we will instead set $g_c = g_{\max}$, the maximum conductance
of the membrane. These choices will ensure $\bar v_{eq}, \bar g \in
[0,1]$.


Inserting the dimensionless variables in 
(ref{scale:bidomain:eqv})-(ref{scale:bidomain:equ_e}), the system
of governing equations becomes

!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta v}{t_c}\chi C_m\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\frac{\sigma_c u_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\
&\quad - \chi g_c \Delta v \bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s)) -\chi I_{\rm{app}},
\\
0 &= \frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) + \frac{\sigma_cu_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\
\end{align*}
!et
Multiplying the equations by appropriate factors leads to equations with
dimensionless terms only:
!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\frac{t_c\sigma_c}{\chi C_mL^2}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\frac{t_c\sigma_c u_c}{\Delta v \chi C_mL^2}\nabla\cdot (\bar
\sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) - \\
&\quad
\frac{g_c t_c}{C_m} \bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s))
- \frac{t_c}{C_m\Delta v} I_{\rm{app}},\\
0 &= \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) + \frac{u_c}{\Delta v}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\
\end{align*}
!et

The time scale is not so obvious to choose. As noted above, the ODE
system that governs $s$ and thereby $\bar g(s), \bar v_{eq} (s)$ may
feature a wide range of spatial scales. Furthermore, even if we focus
on the tissue equations and on the dynamics of $v$ and $u_e$, the
choice of natural time and length scales is not trivial. 
The equations are of reaction-diffusion nature, and the
solution takes the form of a narrow wavefront of activation that
propagates through the tissue. The region immediately surrounding
the wavefront is characterized by large spatial and temporal
gradients, while in most of the
domain the variations are quite slow. For now, we choose the time scale
based on balancing the reaction and diffusion components, as described
in Section ref{sec:scale:diffu:homo1D}.  We therefore
set the terms in front of the reaction term and the diffusion term to
unity, which means

!bt
\[ \frac{t_c\sigma_c}{\chi C_mL^2} = 1,\quad \frac{t_cg_c}{C_m} =1,\]
!et
and determines the time and length scales:

!bt
\[ t_c = \frac{C_m}{g_c},\quad L = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c}{g_c \chi}}\tp\]
!et

Two natural dimensionless variables then arise from the second diffusion
term and the applied current term:
!bt
\[ \beta = \frac{u_c}{\Delta v}, \quad \gamma =
\frac{I_{\rm{app}}}{g_c \Delta v} \tp\]
!et
In many cases it will be natural to set $u_c=\Delta v$, which of
course removes the need for $\beta$, but we
include the freedom to have $u_c$ as
some specified characteristic size of $u_e$ (i.e., $u_c$ is not a
``free parameter'', but is expressed by the other parameters in the
problem).

The final dimensionless system becomes
!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\beta\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) \\
& \quad -\bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s))
- \gamma
\\
0 &= \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) +
\beta\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u) \tp
\end{align}
!et
The two dimensionless variables in these equations have
straightforward
interpretations: $\beta$ is the ratio of the span in the two electric
potentials, and $\gamma$ is ratio of the source term $I_{\rm{app}}$ and the
time-derivative term of $v$, or the source term and the diffusion term
in $v$.

We can insert typical parameter values to get a feel for the
chosen scaling. We have
!bt
\begin{align*}
C_m &= 1.0\, \mu\hbox{F\,cm}^{-2}, \quad g_c = g_{max} = 13.0
\hbox{m\,S}\mu\hbox{F}^{-1} = 13.0 \hbox{mS\,cm}^{-2}, \\
\chi &= 2000 \hbox{cm}^{-1} , \quad u_c = \Delta v = 100 \hbox{mV} , 
\sigma_c = 3.0 \hbox{mS\,cm}^{-1}\tp
\end{align*}
!et

This gives the following values of $t_c$ and $L$:
!bt
\begin{align*}
t_c &= \frac{1.0 \mu\hbox{ F\,cm}^{-2}}{13.0 \mu\hbox{ F\,cm}^{-2}} =
\frac{1.0}{13.0}\frac{\mu\hbox{ F}}{\hbox{mS}} \approx 0.076 \hbox{ ms}, \\
L &= \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c}{\chi g_c}} = \sqrt{\frac{3.0
\hbox{ mS\,cm}^{-2}}{2000\hbox{ cm}^{-1} \mu\hbox{ F\,cm}^-2}}
\approx 0.087 \hbox{ mm} \tp
\end{align*}
!et
These values are both very small, which is related to our
choice of $g_c = g_{\max}$. This choice implies that we base the
scaling on the upstroke phase of the action potential, when both
spatial and temporal variations are extremely high. This may therefore
be a ``correct'' scaling exactly at the wavefront of the electrical
potential, but is less relevant elsewhere. Choosing $g_c$ to be for
instance the resting conductance, which is the common choice when
scaling the cable equation, may increase $t_c, L$ by factors up to 2500 and
50, respectively. The large difference in scales reflects the
difference between active, dynamic signal conduction and passive
signals governed solely by electrodiffusion. 

The conduction velocity is often a quantity of interest, and we could
obtain an alternative relation between $t_c$ and $L$ by setting
$CV = L/t_c$, where $CV$ is the conduction velocity. 
In human cardiac tissue $CV$ is known to be about
60 cm/s, while the choices above give

!bt
\[
\frac{L}{t_c} =  \frac{0.087\rm{mm}}{0.076\rm{ms}} \approx 144 \tp
\hbox{cm/s}\tp \]
!et
Enforcing $L/t_c = 60 \hbox{cm\,s}^{-1}$ gives the constraint $g_c \approx
4.8 \hbox{mS\,cm}^{-2}$, and yields $L \approx 0.17$ mm and
$t_c=0.21$ ms. 
#These are still small values, but very close to the
#standard values of $\Delta x, \Delta t$ required for accurate
#numerical solution. That is, this choice of scaling will give $\Delta x
#\approx \Delta t \approx 1$, instead of $\bar t, \bar x \approx 1$?

#[hpl: That sounds a big strange, but if the focus is on a smaller scale,
#choosing $L$ and $t_c$ from this scale leads to that conclusion.]


===== The bidomain model with an alternative $I_{\rm{ion}}$ =====
The simplest model that gives a qualitatively realistic description of
the cardiac action potential is the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model. In
contrast to the model (ref{scale:bidomain:ion1}) discussed above, the
FHN model is completely phenomenological, with no relation to the
underlying biophysics. However, the model can be parameterized to give
reasonable values for the voltages, and has the advantage of giving a
self-contained and relatively simple model that does not depend on
externally determined variables like the $s$ vector above. As above,
we have the bidomain model given by 
!bt
\begin{align}
\chi C_m\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &=
\nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot (\sigma_i\nabla u_e) - \chi I_{\rm{ion}}
- \chi I_{\rm{app}},
label{scale:bidomain:eqv2}\\
0 &= \nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot ((\sigma_i + \sigma_e)\nabla u_e),
label{scale:bidomain:equ2}
\end{align}
!et
but now with 
!bt
\[ I_{\rm{ion}} = -A[(v-v_r)(v-v_{th})(v-v_p) - w(v-v_r)(v_p-v_r)^2], \]
!et
and $w$ governed by an ODE on the form
!bt
\[ \frac{dw}{dt} = k(v-v_r)-l w \tp\]
!et
Choosing $A=4.16\cdot 10^{-4} \hbox{mS}/(\hbox{mV}^2),  v_r=-85\hbox{mV},
v_{th}= -68\hbox{mV}, v_p=40\hbox{mV}, k = 4.0\cdot10^{-5} \hbox{mV}^{-1}\hbox{ms}^{-1}, l
=0.013\hbox{ms}^{-1}, $ gives reasonably physiological values for $v$,
while $w$ is a dimensionless variable with values in $[0,1]$. 
The somewhat strange choice of parameter units are
required because the function is cubic in $v$. 
Typical initial conditions are $v=v_r, u_e = w=0$,
and $I_{app}$ is piecewise constant in space and time, with a typical
value being $I_{app} = -50 \hbox{mA}$ applied for 2 ms in certain regions of
the domain. 

The equations can be scaled following the same procedure as above. In
addition to the dimensionless variables introduced above, we introduce
!bt
\[
\alpha = \frac{v_{th}-v_r}{\Delta v} ,
\]
!et
and in terms of the dimensionless variables, we get
!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta v}{t_c}\chi C_m\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\frac{\sigma_c u_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\
&\quad - \chi A\Delta v^3 (\bar v (\bar  v-\alpha)(\bar v -1) -
\bar v w) -\chi I_{\rm{app}},
\\
0 &= \frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar
\nabla \bar v) 
+ \frac{\sigma_cu_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\
\frac{1}{t_c} \frac{dw}{dt} &= k \Delta v \bar v
-l w \tp
\end{align*}
!et
As above, we multiply with suitable factors to arrive at
!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\frac{\sigma_c t_c}{L^2 C_m \chi}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\frac{\sigma_c t_c u_c}{\Delta v L^2 C_m \chi}\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\
&\quad - \frac{t_c A\Delta v^2}{C_m} (\bar v (\bar v-\alpha)(\bar v -1) - \bar v
w) -\chi I_{\rm{app}}, \\
0 &= \frac{\sigma_c}{L^2}\bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar
\nabla \bar v) 
+ \frac{\sigma_cu_c}{\Delta v L^2}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\
\frac{dw}{dt}&= k {t_c}{\Delta v} \bar
v -t_c l w \tp
\end{align*}
!et
The time and length scales are again chosen by requiring balance of
the reaction and diffusion term, which gives
!bt
\[ t_c = \frac{C_m}{A \Delta v^2},\quad L = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c}{A
\Delta v^2 \chi}},\tp\]
!et
 and we arrive at the final dimensionless system
!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\alpha \nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\
&\quad - (\bar v (\bar v-\alpha)(\bar v -1) - \bar v
w) -\beta, \\
0 &= \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar
\nabla \bar v) 
+ \alpha \nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\
\frac{dw}{dt}&= \bar k \bar
v -\bar l w ,
\end{align*}
!et
where we have introduced the dimensionless numbers
!bt
\[
\bar k = k {t_c}{\Delta v} , \quad \bar l = t_c l \tp
\]
!et
