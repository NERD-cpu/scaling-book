TITLE:  Scaling of Differential Equations
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen ${copyright_} at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory & Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
AUTHOR: Geir K. Pedersen ${copyright_} at Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo

__Preface.__
This book explains the mathematical details of making differential
equation models dimensionless. A key feature of the text is the reasoning
about the right choice
of scales. A large number of worked examples demonstrate
the scaling technique for ordinary and partial differential equations
from physics and biology. How to utilize scaled models in simulation
software is also addressed.
