<p>Finding proper values of physical parameters in mathematical models is
often quite a challenge. While many have gotten away with using just
the mathematical symbols when doing science and engineering with pen
and paper, the modern world of numerical computing requires each
physical parameter to have a numerical value, otherwise one cannot get
started with the computations.  For example, in the simplest possible
transient heat conduction simulation, a case relevant for a real
physical material needs values for the heat capacity, the density, and
the heat conduction coefficient of the material. In addition, relevant
values must be chosen for initial and boundary temperatures as well as
the size of the material.  With a dimensionless mathematical model, as
explained in the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="._book004.html#sec-scale-diffu"><span class="std std-ref">The diffusion equation</span></a>, <em>no physical quantities</em>
need to be assigned (!). Not only is this a simplification of great
convenience, as one simulation is valid for any type of material, but
it also actually increases the understanding of the physical problem.</p>
<p>Scaling of differential equations is basically a simple mathematical
process, consisting of the chain rule for differentiation and some
algebra.  The <em>choice of scales</em>, however, is a non-trivial topic,
which may cause confusion among practitioners without extensive
experience with scaling.  How to choose scales is unfortunately not
well treated in the literature. Most of the times, authors just state
scales without proper motivation. The choice of scales is highly
problem-dependent and requires knowledge of the characteristic
features of the solution or the physics of the problem.  The present
notes aim at explaining &#8220;all nuts and bolts&#8221; of the scaling
technique, including choice of scales, the algebra, the interpretation
of dimensionless parameters in scaled models, and how scaling impacts
software for solving differential equations.</p>
<p>Traditionally, scaling was mainly used to identify small parameters in
mathematical models, such that perturbation methods based on series
expansions in terms of the small parameters could be used as an
approximate solution method for differential equations.  Nowadays, the
greatest practical benefit of scaling is related to running numerical
simulations, since scaling greatly simplifies the choice of values for
the input data and makes the simulations results more widely
applicable.  The number of parameters in scaled models may be much
less than the number of physical parameters in the original model. The
parameters in scaled models are also dimensionless and express
<em>ratios</em> of physical effects rather than levels of individual
effects.  Setting meaningful values of a few dimensionless numbers is
much easier than determining physically relevant values for the
original physical parameters.</p>
<p>Another great benefit of scaling is the physical insight that follows
from dimensionless parameters. Since physical effects enter the
problem through a few dimensionless groups, one can from these groups
see how different effects compete in their impact on the
solution. Ideally, a good physical understanding should provide the
same insight, but it is not always easy to &#8220;think right&#8221; and realize
how spatial and temporal scales interact with physical parameters.
This interaction becomes clear through the dimensionless numbers, and
such numbers are therefore a great help, especially for students, in
developing a correct physical understanding.</p>
<p>Since we have a special focus on scaling related to numerical
simulations, the notes contain a lot of examples on how to program
with dimensionless differential equation models. Most numerical models
feature quantities with dimension, so we show in particular how to
utilize such existing models to solve the equations in the associated
scaled model.</p>
<p>Scaling is not a universal mathematical technique as the details
depend on the problem at hand. We therefore present scaling in a range
of specific applications, starting with simple ODEs, progressing with
basic PDEs, before attacking more complicated models, especially from
fluid mechanics.</p>
<p>The chapter <a class="reference internal" href="._book002.html#scale-dimunit"><span class="std std-ref">Dimensions and units</span></a> discusses units and how to make programs
that can automatically take care of unit conversion (the most frequent
mathematical mistake in industry and science?).  The section <a class="reference internal" href="._book003.html#sec-scale-decay"><span class="std std-ref">Exponential decay problems</span></a> introduces the mathematics of scaling and the
thinking about scales in a simple ODE problem modeling exponential
decay. The ideas are generalized to nonlinear ODEs and to systems of
ODEs.  Another ODE example, on mechanical vibrations, is treated in
the section <a class="reference internal" href="._book003.html#sec-scale-vib"><span class="std std-ref">Vibration problems</span></a>, where we cover many different physical
contexts and different choices of scales.  Scaling the standard,
linear wave equation is the topic of the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="._book004.html#sec-scale-wave"><span class="std std-ref">The wave equation</span></a>, with
discussion of how boundary and initial conditions influence the choice
of scales.  Another PDE example, the diffusion equation, appears in
the chapter <a class="reference internal" href="._book004.html#sec-scale-diffu"><span class="std std-ref">The diffusion equation</span></a>. Here we progress from a simple linear
diffusion equation in 1D to a study of how scales are influenced by
an oscillatory boundary condition. Nonlinear diffusion models, as well as
convection-diffusion PDEs, are elaborated on.  The final Chapter is
devoted to many famous PDEs arising from continuum models: elasticity,
viscous fluid flow, thermal convection, etc.</p>
<p>The mathematics is translated into complete computer codes for the
ODE and simpler PDE problems.</p>
<p>Experimental fluid mechanics is a field full of relations involving
dimensionless numbers such as the Grashof and Prandtl
numbers, but none of the textbooks the authors have seen explain how
these numbers actually relate to dimensionless forms of the governing
equations. Consequently, this non-trivial topic is particularly
highlighted in the fluid mechanics examples.</p>
<p>The mathematics in the first two chapters is very gentle and requires
no more background than basic one-variable calculus and preferably
some knowledge of differential equation models. The next chapter
involves PDEs and assumes familiarity with basic models for wave
phenomena, diffusion, and combined convection-diffusion. The final
chapter is meant for readers with knowledge of the physics and
mathematics of continuum mechanical models. The mathematical level of
the text rises quickly after the first two chapters.</p>
<p>In the first two chapters, much of the mathematics is accompanied
by complete (yet short) computer codes. The programming level requires
familiarity with procedural programming in Python. As the mathematical
level rises, the computer codes get much more comprehensive, and we refer
to some files for computational examples in chapter three.</p>
<p>The pedagogy is to saturate the reader with lots of detailed examples to
provide an understanding for the topic, primarily because the choice
of scales depends on the problem at hand. One can also view the notes
as a reference on how to scale many of the most important differential
equation models in physics.  For the simpler differential equations in
Chapters 2 and 3, we present computer code for many computational
examples, but the treatment of the advanced models in Chapter 4 is
more superficial to limit the size of that chapter.</p>
<p>The exercises are named either Exercise or Problem. The latter is
a stand-alone exercise without reference to the rest of the text, while
the former typically extends a topic in the text or refers to sections or
formulas in the text.</p>
<div class="admonition-what-this-booklet-is-and-is-not admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">What this booklet is and is not</p>
<p>Books containing material on
scaling and non-dimensionalization very often cover
topics not treated in the present notes, e.g., the key topic of
dimensional analysis and the famous Buckingham Pi Theorem
<a class="reference internal" href="._book005.html#ref01" id="id1">[Ref01]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="._book005.html#ref02" id="id2">[Ref02]</a>, which we discuss only briefly in
the section <a class="reference internal" href="._book002.html#scale-dimunit-pi"><span class="std std-ref">The Buckingham Pi theorem</span></a>. Similarly,
analytical solution methods like perturbation techniques
and similarity solutions, which represent classical methods
closely related to scaling and non-dimensionalization, are not
addressed herein.
There are numerous texts on perturbation techniques, and these methods
build on an already scaled differential equations. Similarity
solutions do not fit within the present scope since these involve
non-dimensional <em>combinations</em> of the unscaled independent variables to derive
new differential equations that are easier to solve.</p>
<p class="last">Our scope is to scale differential
equations to simplify the setting of parameters in numerical simulations,
and at the same time understand more of the physics
through interpretation of the dimensionless numbers that automatically
arise from the scaling procedure.</p>
</div>
<p>With these notes, we hope to demystify the thinking involved in scale
determination and encourage numerical simulations to be performed with
dimensionless differential equation models.</p>
