This final chapter addresses more complicated PDE models, including
linear elasticity, viscous flow, heat transfer, porous media flow,
gas dynamics, and electrophysiology. A range of
classical dimensionless numbers are discussed in terms of the scaling.

.. _scale:elasticity:

The equations of linear elasticity
==================================

To the best of the authors' knowledge, it seems that mathematical
models in elasticity and structural analysis are almost never
non-dimensionalized. This is probably due to tradition, but the
following sections will demonstrate the usefulness of scaling also in
this scientific field.

We start out with the general, time-dependent elasticity PDE with
variable material properties. Analysis based on scaling is used to
determine under what circumstances the acceleration term can be neglected
and we end up with the widely used stationary
elasticity PDE. Scaling of different types of boundary conditions is
also treated.  At the end, we scale the equations of coupled
thermo-elasticity. All the models make the assumption of small
displacement gradients and Hooke's generalized constitutive law
such that linear elasticity theory applies.

.. _scale:elasticity:timedep:

The general time-dependent elasticity problem
---------------------------------------------

The following vector PDE governs deformation and stress in purely elastic
materials, under the assumption of small displacement gradients:

.. _Eq:scale:elasticity:PDE1:

.. math::

    \tag{200}
    \varrho\frac{\partial^2\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t^2} =
        \nabla ((\lambda + \mu)\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}) + \nabla\cdot(\mu\nabla\boldsymbol{u}) +
        \varrho\boldsymbol{f}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Here, :math:`\boldsymbol{u}` is the displacement vector,
:math:`\varrho` is the density of the material, :math:`\lambda` and :math:`\mu` are
the Lame elasticity parameters, and :math:`\boldsymbol{f}` is a body force (gravity,
centrifugal force, or similar).

We introduce dimensionless variables:

.. math::
         \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = u_c^{-1}\boldsymbol{u},\quad \bar x = \frac{x}{L}
        \quad \bar y = \frac{y}{L}
        \quad \bar z = \frac{z}{L},
        \quad \bar t = \frac{f}{t_c}{\thinspace .}

Also the elasticity parameters and the density can be scaled, if they
are not constants,

.. math::
         \bar\lambda = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_c},\quad
        \bar\mu = \frac{\mu}{\mu_c},\quad
        \bar\varrho = \frac{\varrho}{\varrho_c},

where the characteristic quantities are typically spatial maximum values of
the functions:

.. math::
         \lambda_c = \max_{x,y,z}\lambda,\quad
        \mu_c = \max_{x,y,z}\mu,\quad
        \varrho_c = \max_{x,y,z}\varrho{\thinspace .}

Finally, we scale :math:`\boldsymbol{f}` too (if not constant):

.. math::
         \bar{\boldsymbol{f}} = f_c^{-1}\boldsymbol{f},\quad f_c = \max_{x,y,z,t}||\boldsymbol{f}||{\thinspace .}

Inserting the dimensionless quantities in the governing vector PDE results in

.. math::
        
        \frac{\varrho_c u_c}{t_c^2}
        \frac{\partial^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar{t}^2} =
        L^{-2}u_c\bar{\nabla} ((\lambda_c\bar{\lambda} +
        \mu_c\bar{\mu})\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        L^{-2}u_c\mu_c\bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \varrho_cf_c\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}{\thinspace .}
        

Making the terms non-dimensional gives the equation

.. _Eq:_auto71:

.. math::

    \tag{201}
    \bar{\varrho}\frac{\partial^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar{t}^2} =
        \frac{t_c^2\lambda_c}{L^2\varrho_c}
        \bar{\nabla} (\bar{\lambda}\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \frac{t_c^2\mu_c}{L^2\varrho_c}
        \bar{\nabla}(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \frac{t_c^2\mu_c}{L^2\varrho_c}\bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \frac{t_c^2f_c}{u_c}\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

We may choose :math:`t_c` to make the coefficient in front of any of the spatial
derivative terms equal unity. Here we choose the :math:`\mu` term, which implies

.. math::
         t_c = L\sqrt{\frac{\varrho_c}{\mu_c}}{\thinspace .}

The scale for :math:`\boldsymbol{u}` can be chosen from an initial displacement or by
making the coefficient in front of the :math:`\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}` term unity. The latter
means

.. math::
         u_c = \mu_c^{-1}\varrho_cf_cL^2{\thinspace .}

As discussed later, in the section :ref:`scale:elasticity:stationary`,
this might not be the desired :math:`u_c` in applications.

The resulting dimensionless PDE becomes

.. _Eq:_auto72:

.. math::

    \tag{202}
    \bar{\varrho}\frac{\partial^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar{t}^2} =
        \bar{\nabla} ((\beta\bar{\lambda} + \bar{\mu})\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The only dimensionless parameter is

.. math::
         \beta = \frac{\lambda_c}{\mu_c}{\thinspace .}

If the source term is absent, we must use the initial condition or
a known boundary displacement to
determine :math:`u_c`.

Software          (8)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given software for :ref:`(200) <Eq:scale:elasticity:PDE1>`,
we can simulate the dimensionless problem by setting :math:`\varrho =\bar\varrho`,
:math:`\lambda =\beta\bar\lambda`, and :math:`\mu = \bar\mu`.

.. _scale:elasticity:PDE1:stress:

Dimensionless stress tensor
---------------------------

The stress tensor :math:`\boldsymbol{\sigma}` is a key quantity in elasticity and is given by

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \lambda\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}\boldsymbol{I} + \mu(\nabla\boldsymbol{u} + (\nabla\boldsymbol{u})^T){\thinspace .}

This :math:`\boldsymbol{\sigma}` can be computed as soon as the PDE problem for :math:`\boldsymbol{u}`
has been solved.
Inserting dimensionless variables on the right-hand side of the above
relation gives

.. math::
        
        \boldsymbol{\sigma} &= \lambda_cu_cL^{-2}\bar{\lambda}\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        + \mu_cu_cL^{-1}\bar{\mu}(\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} + (\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}})^T)\\ 
        &= \mu_c u_cL^{-1}\left(\beta\bar{\lambda}\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} +
        \bar{\mu}(\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} + (\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}})^T)\right){\thinspace .}
        

The coefficient on the right-hand side, :math:`\mu_c u_cL^{-1}`, has dimension
of stress, since (according to the second table in
the section :ref:`scale:dimunit:tables`) :math:`[\hbox{M}\hbox{T}^{-2}\hbox{L}^{-1})(\hbox{L})(\hbox{L}^{-1})]
=[\hbox{M}\hbox{T}^{-2}\hbox{L}^{-1}]`, which is the dimension of stress.
The quantity :math:`\mu_c u_cL^{-1}` is therefore the natural scale of the
stress tensor:

.. math::
         \bar{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}{\sigma_c},\quad \sigma_c = \mu_c u_c L^{-1},

and we have the dimensionless stress-displacement relation

.. _Eq:_auto73:

.. math::

    \tag{203}
    \bar{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} =
        \beta\bar{\lambda}\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} +
        \bar{\mu}(\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} + (\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}})^T){\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _scale:elasticity:waves:

When can the acceleration term be neglected?
--------------------------------------------

A lot of applications of the elasticity equation involve static or
quasi-static deformations where the acceleration term
:math:`\varrho\boldsymbol{u}_{tt}` is neglected. Now we shall see under which conditions
the quasi-static approximation holds.

The further discussion will need to look into the time scales of
elastic waves, because it turns out that the chosen :math:`t_c` above is
closely linked to the propagation speed of elastic waves in a
homogeneous body without body forces.  A relevant model for
such waves has constant
:math:`\varrho`, :math:`\lambda`, and :math:`\mu`, and no force term:

.. _Eq:scale:elasticity:waves:eq:

.. math::

    \tag{204}
    \varrho\frac{\partial^2\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t^2} =
        (\lambda + \mu)\nabla \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} + \mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u}{\thinspace .}
        
        

S waves
~~~~~~~

Let us take the curl of this PDE and notice
that the curl of a  gradient vanishes. The result is

.. math::
        \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\nabla\times\boldsymbol{u} = c_S^2\nabla^2\nabla\times\boldsymbol{u},

i.e., a wave equation for :math:`\nabla\times\boldsymbol{u}`. The wave velocity is

.. math::
         c_S = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varrho}}{\thinspace .}

The corresponding waves are called
`S waves <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-wave>`__. The curl of a
displacement field is closely related to rotation of continuum elements.
S waves are therefore rotation waves, also sometimes referred to as
shear waves.

The divergence of a displacement field can be interpreted as the
volume change of continuum elements. Suppose this volume change vanishes,
:math:`\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0`, which means that the material is incompressible.
The elasticity equation then simplifies to

.. _Eq:scale:elasticity:waves:Sweq:

.. math::

    \tag{205}
    \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t^2} = c_S^2\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u},
        

so each component of
the displacement field in this case also propagates as a wave
with speed :math:`c_S^2`.
The time it takes for such a wave to travel one characteristic length
:math:`L` is :math:`L/c_S`, i.e., :math:`L\sqrt{\varrho/\mu}`, which is nothing but
our characteristic time :math:`t_c`.

P waves
~~~~~~~

We may take the divergence of the PDE instead and notice that :math:`\nabla\cdot\nabla
=\nabla^2` so

.. math::
        \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = c_P^2\nabla^2\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u},

with wave velocity

.. math::
         c_P = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda +2\mu}{\varrho}}{\thinspace .}

That is, the volume change (expansion/compression)
propagates as a wave with speed :math:`c_P`.
These types of waves are called `P waves <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-wave>`__. Other names are pressure and expansion/compression waves.

Suppose now that :math:`\nabla\times\boldsymbol{u} =0`, i.e., there is no rotation ("shear") of
continuum elements. Mathematically this condition implies that
:math:`\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} = \nabla(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u})` (see any book on vector calculus
or `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities>`__).
Our model equation :ref:`(204) <Eq:scale:elasticity:waves:eq>` then reduces to

.. _Eq:scale:elasticity:waves:Pweq:

.. math::

    \tag{206}
    \frac{\partial^2\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t^2} = c_P^2\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u},
        

which is nothing but a wave equation for the expansion component of the
displacement field, just as :ref:`(205) <Eq:scale:elasticity:waves:Sweq>` is for the
shear component.

Time-varying load
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose we have some time-varying boundary condition on :math:`\boldsymbol{u}` or the
stress vector (traction), with a time scale :math:`1/\omega` (some
oscillating movement that goes like :math:`\sin\omega t`, for instance). We
choose :math:`t_c=1/\omega`.  The scaling now leads to

.. math::
        
        \gamma
        \frac{\partial^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar{t}^2} =
        \bar{\nabla} ((\beta\bar{\lambda} +
        \bar{\mu})\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}{\thinspace .}
        

where we have set

.. math::
         u_c = \mu_c^{-1}f_cL^2\varrho_c,

as before, and :math:`\gamma` is a new dimensionless number,

.. math::
         \gamma = \frac{\varrho_cL^2 \omega^2}{\mu_c} =
        \left(\frac{L\sqrt{\varrho_c/\mu_c}}{1/\omega}\right)^2{\thinspace .}

The last rewrite shows that :math:`\sqrt{\gamma}` is the ratio of
the time scale for S waves and the time scale for the forced
movement on the boundary. The acceleration term can therefore
be neglected when :math:`\gamma\ll 1`, i.e., when the time scale
for movement on the boundary is much larger than the time it
takes for the S waves to travel through the domain.
Since the velocity of S waves in solids is very large and
the time scale correspondingly small, :math:`\gamma\ll 1`
is very often the case in applications involving structural analysis.
:ref:`scale::exer:elasticity:vibmodels` explores related
models and asks for comparisons of time scales for waves and
mechanical vibrations in structures.

.. _scale:elasticity:stationary:

The stationary elasticity problem
---------------------------------

Scaling of the PDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now look at the stationary version of :ref:`(200) <Eq:scale:elasticity:PDE1>`
where the :math:`\varrho\boldsymbol{u}_{tt}` term is removed. The first step in the
scaling is just inserting the dimensionless variables:

.. math::
        
        0 =
        L^{-2}u_c\bar{\nabla} ((\lambda_c\bar{\lambda} +
        \mu_c\bar{\mu})\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        L^{-2}u_c\mu_c\bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \varrho_cf_c\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}{\thinspace .}
        

Dividing by :math:`L^2u_c\mu_c` gives

.. math::
        
        0 =
        \bar{\nabla} ((\beta\bar{\lambda} +
        \bar{\mu})\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \frac{L^2\varrho_cf_c}{u_c\mu_c}\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{f}}{\thinspace .}
        

Choosing :math:`u_c = \varrho L^2f_c/\mu_c` leads to

.. _Eq:_auto74:

.. math::

    \tag{207}
    \bar{\nabla} ((\beta\bar\{lambda} +
        \bar{\mu})\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar\varrho\bar{\boldsymbol{f}} = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

A homogeneous material with constant :math:`\lambda`, :math:`\mu`, and :math:`\varrho`
is an interesting case (this corresponds to :math:`\mu_c=\mu`, :math:`\lambda_c=\lambda`,
:math:`\varrho_c=\varrho`, :math:`\bar\varrho=\bar\lambda=\bar\mu=1`):

.. _Eq:_auto75:

.. math::

    \tag{208}
    (1+\beta)\bar{\nabla}(\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\nabla}^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{f}} = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

Now :math:`\beta` is defined as

.. math::
         \beta = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} = \left(\frac{c_p}{c_s}\right)^2 - 2{\thinspace .}

It shows that in standard, stationary elasticity, :math:`\lambda/\mu` is the
only significant physical parameter.

Remark on the characteristic displacement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. The choice of :math:`u_c` may require a comment. If we end up with

.. :math:`\bar\boldsymbol{u}` and a geometry of order one, it means that plotting the

.. deformation (typically the deformed mesh used in a simulation) will

.. look very strange.  We usually want the characteristic displacement to

.. be a small fraction of the characteristic size of the elastic

.. body.

The presented scaling may not be valid for problems where the geometry
involves some dimensions that are much smaller than others, such as for
beams, shells, or plates. Then one more length scale must be defined
which gives us non-dimensional geometrical numbers.  Global balances of
moments and loads then determine how characteristic displacements
depend on these numbers. As an example, consider a cantilever beam of
length :math:`L` and square-shaped cross section of width :math:`W`, deformed
under its own weight.  From beam theory one can derive :math:`u_c =
\frac{3}{2}\varrho g L^2\delta^2/E`, where :math:`\delta = L/W` (:math:`g` is the
acceleration of gravity). If we consider :math:`E` to be of the same size as
:math:`\lambda`, this implies that :math:`\gamma\sim\delta^{-2}`. So, it may be
wise to prescribe a :math:`u_c` in elasticity problems, perhaps from
formulas as shown, and keep :math:`\gamma` in the PDE.

Scaling of displacement boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A typical boundary condition on some part of the boundary is a prescribed
displacement. For simplicity, we set :math:`\boldsymbol{u} = \boldsymbol{U}_0` for a constant vector
:math:`\boldsymbol{U}_0` as boundary condition. With :math:`u_c=\varrho L^2f_c/\mu`, we get
the dimensionless condition

.. math::
         \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{U}_0}{u_c} = \frac{\mu \boldsymbol{U}_0}{\varrho L^2f_c}{\thinspace .}

In the absence of body forces, the expression for :math:`u_c` has no
meaning (:math:`f_c=0`), so then :math:`u_c = |\boldsymbol{U}_0|` is a better choice.
This gives the dimensionless boundary condition

.. math::
         \bar{u} = \frac{\boldsymbol{U}_0}{|\boldsymbol{U}_0|},

which is the unit vector in the direction of :math:`\boldsymbol{U}_0`. The new :math:`u_c`
changes the coefficient in front of the body force term, if that term
is present, to the dimensionless number

.. math::
         \delta = \frac{L^2\varrho f_c}{\mu |\boldsymbol{U}_0|}{\thinspace .}

Scaling of traction boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The other type of common boundary condition in elasticity is a
prescribed traction (stress vector) on some part of the boundary:

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{n} = \boldsymbol{T}_0,

where, to make it simple, we take :math:`\boldsymbol{T}_0` as a constant vector.
From the section :ref:`scale:elasticity:PDE1:stress` we have a stress scale
:math:`\sigma_c = \mu u_c/L`, but we may alternatively use :math:`|\boldsymbol{T}_0|`
as stress scale. In that case,

.. math::
         \bar{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot\boldsymbol{n} = \frac{\boldsymbol{T}_0}{|\boldsymbol{T}_0|},

which is a unit vector in the direction of :math:`\boldsymbol{T}_0`.
Many applications involve large traction free areas on the boundary, on
which we simply have :math:`\bar{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot\boldsymbol{n} = 0`.

.. _scale:elasticity:thermo:

Quasi-static thermo-elasticity
------------------------------

.. index:: thermo-elasticity

Heating solids gives rise to expansion, i.e., strains, which may cause
stress if displacements are constrained. The time scale of temperature
changes are usually much larger than the time scales of elastic waves,
so the stationary equations of elasticity can be used, but a term
depends on the temperature, so the equations must be coupled to
a PDE for heat transfer in solids. The resulting system of PDEs is
known as the equations of *thermo-elasticity* and reads

.. _Eq:_auto76:

.. math::

    \tag{209}
    \nabla((\lambda + \mu)\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}) + \nabla\cdot(\mu\nabla\boldsymbol{u}) = \alpha\nabla T -\varrho\boldsymbol{f},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto77:

.. math::

    \tag{210}
    \varrho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \varrho \boldsymbol{f}_T,
        
        

where :math:`T` is the temperature, :math:`\alpha` is a coefficient of thermal expansion,
:math:`c` is a heat capacity, :math:`\kappa` is the heat conduction coefficient,
and :math:`\boldsymbol{f}_T` is some heat source. The density :math:`\varrho` is strictly speaking
a function of :math:`T` and the stress state, but a widely used approximation
is to consider :math:`\varrho` as a constant.
Most thermo-elasticity applications have
:math:`\boldsymbol{f}_T=0`, so we drop this term. Most applications also involve some heating
from a temperature level :math:`T_0` to some level :math:`T_0 +\Delta T`.
A suitable scaling for :math:`T` is therefore

.. math::
         \bar{T} = \frac{T-T_0}{\Delta T},

so that :math:`\bar{T}\in [0,1]`. The elasticity equation has already been scaled
and so has the diffusion equation for :math:`T`. We base the time scale on
the diffusion, i.e., the thermal conduction process:

.. math::
         t_c = \varrho c L^2/\kappa_c{\thinspace .}

We imagine that :math:`\kappa` is scaled as :math:`\bar\kappa = \kappa/\kappa_c`.
The dimensionless PDE system then becomes

.. _Eq:_auto78:

.. math::

    \tag{211}
    \bar{\nabla}((1+\beta)\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\mu}\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) = \bar{\nabla}\bar{T}
        -\epsilon\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{f}},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto79:

.. math::

    \tag{212}
    \frac{\partial\bar{T}}{\partial\bar{t}} =
        \bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\kappa}\bar{\nabla}\bar{T}){\thinspace .}
        
        

Here we have chosen :math:`u_c` such that
the "heating source term" has a unit coefficient, acknowledging that
this thermal expansion balances the stress terms with :math:`\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}`. The
corresponding displacement scale is

.. math::
         u_c = \frac{\alpha L\Delta T}{\mu_c}{\thinspace .}

The dimensionless number in the body force term is therefore

.. math::
         \epsilon = \frac{L\varrho_c f_c}{\alpha \Delta T},

which measures the ratio of the body force term and the "heating source
term".

A homogeneous body with constant :math:`\varrho`, :math:`\lambda`, :math:`\mu`, :math:`c`, and :math:`\kappa`
is common. The PDE system reduces in this case to

.. _Eq:_auto80:

.. math::

    \tag{213}
    \bar{\nabla}((1+\beta)\bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) +
        \bar{\nabla}^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) = \bar{\nabla}\bar{T} -\epsilon\bar{\boldsymbol{f}},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto81:

.. math::

    \tag{214}
    \frac{\partial\bar{T}}{\partial\bar{t}} = \bar{\nabla}^2\bar{T}{\thinspace .}
        
        

In the absence of body forces, :math:`\beta` is again the key parameter.

The boundary conditions for thermo-elasticity consist of the conditions
for elasticity and the conditions
for diffusion. Scaling of such conditions are discussed in
the section :ref:`sec:scale:diffu` and :ref:`scale:elasticity:stationary`.

.. _sec:scale:ns:

The Navier-Stokes equations
===========================

.. index:: Navier-Stokes equations

This section shows how to scale various versions of the
equations governing incompressible viscous fluid flow. We start
with the plain Navier-Stokes equations without body forces and
progress with adding the gravity force and a free surface. We
also look at scaling low Reynolds number flow and oscillating flows.

The momentum equation without body forces
-----------------------------------------

.. index:: dimensionless number

.. index:: Reynolds number

The Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous fluid flow,
without body forces, take the form

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum:

.. math::

    \tag{215}
    \varrho\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}\right)
        = -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:cont:

.. math::

    \tag{216}
    \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}  = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

The primary unknowns are the
velocity :math:`\boldsymbol{u}` and the pressure :math:`p`. Moreover,
:math:`\varrho` is the fluid density, and :math:`\mu` is the dynamic viscosity.

Scaling          (7)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start, as usual, by introducing a notation for
dimensionless independent and dependent variables:

.. math::
         \bar{x} = \frac{x}{L},\quad \bar{y} = \frac{y}{L},\quad
        \bar{z}= \frac{z}{L},\quad \bar{t} = \frac{t}{t_c},\quad
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{u}}{u_c},\quad \bar{p} = \frac{p}{p_c},

where :math:`L` is some characteristic distance,
:math:`t_c` is some characteristic time, :math:`u_c` is a characteristic
velocity, while :math:`p_c` is a characteristic pressure.
Inserted in the equations,

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum_d0:

.. math::

    \tag{217}
    \varrho\left(\frac{u_c}{t_c}\frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} + \frac{u_c^2}{L}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\right)
        = -\frac{p_c}{L}\bar\nabla\bar p + \frac{u_c}{L^2}\mu\bar \nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:cont_d0:

.. math::

    \tag{218}
    \frac{u_c}{L}\bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}  = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

For the velocity it is common to just introduce some :math:`U` for
:math:`u_c`. This :math:`U` is normally implied by the problem description.  For
example, in the flow configuration below, with flow over a bump, we
have some incoming flow with a profile :math:`v(y)` and :math:`U` can typically be
chosen as :math:`U=\max_y v(y)`. The height of the bump influences the wake
behind the bump, and is the length scale that really impacts the flow,
so it is natural to set :math:`L=D`. For numerical simulations in a domain
of finite extent, :math:`[0,c+\ell]`, :math:`c` must be large enough to avoid
feedback on the inlet profile, and :math:`\ell` must be large enough for the
type of outflow boundary condition used.  Ideally,
:math:`c,\ell\rightarrow\infty`, so none of these parameters are useful as
length scales.

For flow in a channel or tube, we also have some inlet profile, e.g.,
:math:`v(r)` in a tube, where :math:`r` is the radial coordinate. A natural
choice of characteristic velocity is :math:`U=v(0)` or to let :math:`U` be
the average flow, i.e.,

.. math::
         U = \frac{1}{\pi R^2}\int_0^R 2\pi v(r)rdr,

if :math:`R` is the radius of the tube. Other examples may be flow around
a body, where there is some distant constant inlet flow :math:`\boldsymbol{u} = U_0\boldsymbol{i}`,
for instance, and :math:`U=U_0` is an obvious choice. We therefore
assume that the flow problem itself brings a natural candidate for :math:`U`.

Having a characteristic distance :math:`L` and velocity :math:`U`, an obvious
time measure is :math:`L/U` so we set :math:`t_c=L/U`. Dividing by the
coefficient in front of the time derivative term, creates a pressure
term

.. math::
         \frac{p_c}{\varrho U^2}\bar\nabla\bar p{\thinspace .}

The coefficient suggest a choice :math:`p_c=\varrho U^2` if the pressure
gradient term is to have the same size as the acceleration terms.
This :math:`p_c` is a very common pressure scale in fluid mechanics,
arising from Bernoulli's equation

.. index:: Bernoulli's equation

.. math::
         p + \frac{1}{2}\varrho \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{u} =
        \hbox{const}

for stationary flow.

.. index:: Reynolds number

Dimensonless PDEs and the Reynolds number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The discussions so far result in the following dimensionless form of
:ref:`(215) <Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum>` and :ref:`(216) <Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:cont>`:

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum_d1:

.. math::

    \tag{219}
    \frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        = -\bar\nabla\bar p + \hbox{Re}^{-1}\bar\nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto82:

.. math::

    \tag{220}
    \bar\nabla\cdot \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = 0,
        
        

where Re is the famous *Reynolds number*,

.. math::
         \hbox{Re}= \frac{\varrho UL}{\mu} = \frac{UL}{\nu}{\thinspace .}

The latter expression makes use of the kinematic viscosity :math:`\nu = \mu/\varrho`.
For viscous fluid flows without body forces there is hence only one
dimensionless number, Re.

The Reynolds number can be interpreted as the ratio of convection and
viscosity:

.. math::
         \frac{\hbox{convection}}{\hbox{viscosity}} =
        \frac{|\varrho\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}|}{|\mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u}|}\sim
        \frac{\varrho U^2/L}{\mu U/L^2} =
        \frac{UL}{\nu} = \hbox{Re}{\thinspace .}

(We have here used that :math:`\nabla\boldsymbol{u}` goes like :math:`U/L` and :math:`\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u}`
goes like :math:`U/L^2`.)

.. index:: low Reynolds number flow

.. index:: Stokes problem

Scaling of time for low Reynolds numbers
----------------------------------------

As we discussed in the section :ref:`scale:convdiff` for the convection-diffusion
equation, there is not just one scaling that fits all problems.
Above, we used :math:`t_c=L/U`, which is appropriate if convection is
a dominating physical effect. In case the convection term
:math:`\varrho\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}`
is much smaller
than the viscosity term :math:`\mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u}`, i.e., the Reynolds number
is small, the viscosity term is dominating. However,
if the scaling is right, the other terms are of order unity, and
:math:`\hbox{Re}^{-1}\nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}` must then also be of unit size. This fact
implies that :math:`\nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}` must be small, but then the scaling is
not right (since a right scaling will lead to :math:`\bar u` and its derivatives
around unity). Such reasoning around inconsistent size of terms clearly points
to the need for other scales.

In the low-Reynolds number regime, the diffusion effect
of :math:`\nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}` is dominating, and we should use a time scale
based on diffusion rather than convection. Such a time scale is
:math:`t_c = L^2/(\mu/\varrho) = L^2/\nu`.
With this time scale, the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations look like

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum_d2:

.. math::

    \tag{221}
    \frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} +
        \hbox{Re}\,\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        = -\bar\nabla p + \bar\nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto83:

.. math::

    \tag{222}
    \bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

As stated in the box in the section :ref:`scale:convdiff`, :ref:`(221) <Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum_d2>` is the appropriate PDE for very low Reynolds number flow and
suggests neglecting the convection term.
If the flow is also steady, the time derivative term can be neglected,
and we end up with the so-called *Stokes problem* for steady, slow, viscous
flow:

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum_d3:

.. math::

    \tag{223}
    -\bar\nabla p + \bar\nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto84:

.. math::

    \tag{224}
    \bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

This flow regime is also known as *Stokes' flow* or *creeping flow*.

.. index:: Stokes' flow

.. index:: Froude number

.. index:: creeping flow

Shear stress as pressure scale
------------------------------

Instead of using the kinetic energy :math:`\varrho U^2` as pressure scale,
one can use the shear stress :math:`\mu U/L` (:math:`U/L` reflects the spatial
derivative of the velocity, which enters the shear stress expression
:math:`\mu\partial u/\partial y`). Using :math:`U` as velocity scale, :math:`L/U` as
time scale, and :math:`\mu U/L` as pressure scale, results in

.. _Eq:_auto85:

.. math::

    \tag{225}
    \hbox{Re}\left(\frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\right)
        = -\bar\nabla\bar p + \bar\nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Low Reynolds number flow now suggests neglecting both acceleration terms.

Gravity force and the Froude number
-----------------------------------

We now add a gravity force to the momentum equation
:ref:`(215) <Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum>`:

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum_g:

.. math::

    \tag{226}
    \varrho\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}\right)
        = -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} - \varrho g\boldsymbol{k},
        
        

where :math:`g` is the acceleration of gravity, and :math:`\boldsymbol{k}` is a unit
vector in the opposite direction of gravity. The new term
takes the following form after non-dimensionalization:

.. math::
         \frac{t_c}{\varrho  u_c}\varrho g \boldsymbol{k} =  \frac{Lg}{U^2}\boldsymbol{k}
        = \hbox{Fr}^{-2}\boldsymbol{k},

where Fr is the dimensionless Froude number,

.. math::
         \hbox{Fr} = \frac{U}{\sqrt{Lg}}{\thinspace .}

This quantity reflects the ratio of inertia and gravity forces:

.. math::
         \frac{|\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}|}{|\varrho g|} \sim \frac{\varrho U^2/L}{\varrho g}
        = \hbox{Fr}^2{\thinspace .}

Oscillating boundary conditions and the Strouhal number
-------------------------------------------------------

.. index:: Strouhal number

Many flows have an oscillating nature, often arising from some
oscillating boundary condition. Suppose such a condition, at some
boundary :math:`x=\hbox{const}`, takes the specific form

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{u} = U\sin(\omega t)\boldsymbol{i}{\thinspace .}

The dimensionless counterpart becomes

.. math::
         U\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = U\sin(\omega \frac{L}{U}\bar t)\boldsymbol{i},

if :math:`t_c=L/U` is the appropriate time scale. This condition can be
written

.. _Eq:_auto86:

.. math::

    \tag{227}
    \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = \sin(\hbox{St}\,\bar t),
        
        

where St is the *Strouhal number*,

.. _Eq:_auto87:

.. math::

    \tag{228}
    \hbox{St} = \frac{\omega L}{U}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The two important dimensionless parameters in oscillating flows are
then the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers.

.. index:: vortex shedding

Even if the boundary conditions
are of steady type, as for flow around a sphere or cylinder,
the flow may at certain Reynolds numbers get unsteady and oscillating.
For :math:`10^2 < \hbox{Re} < 10^7`, steady inflow towards a cylinder will
cause vortex shedding: an array of vortices are periodically shedded
from the cylinder, producing an oscillating flow pattern and force
on the cylinder. The Strouhal number is used to characterize the
frequency of oscillations. The phenomenon, known as *von Karman
vortex street*, is particularly important if the frequency
of the force on the cylinder hits the free vibration frequency
of the cylinder such that resonance occurs. The result can be large
displacements of the cylinder and structural failure. A famous
case in engineering is the failure of the `Tacoma Narrows suspension
bridge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)>`__
in 1940, when wind-induced vortex shedding caused resonance
with the free torsional vibrations of the bridge.

.. index:: Euler number

Cavitation and the Euler number
-------------------------------

The dimensionless pressure in :ref:`(219) <Eq:scale:fluid:NS:eq:momentum_d1>`
made use of the pressure scale :math:`p_c=\varrho U^2`. This is an
appropriate scale if the pressure level is not of importance, which
is very often the case since only the pressure *gradient* enters
the flow equation and drives the flow. However, there are circumstances
where the pressure level is of importance. For example, in some flows
the pressure may become so low that the vapor pressure of the liquid
is reached and that vapor cavities form (a phenomenon known as
*cavitation*). A more appropriate pressure scale is then
:math:`p_c = p_{\infty} - p_v`, where :math:`p_\infty` is a characteristic
pressure level far from vapor cavities and :math:`p_v` is the vapor pressure.
The coefficient in front of the dimensionless pressure gradient is then

.. math::
         \frac{p_{\infty} - p_v}{\varrho U^2}{\thinspace .} 

Inspired by Bernoulli's equation
:math:`p + \frac{1}{2}\varrho \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{u} =
\hbox{const}`
in fluid mechanics, a factor :math:`\frac{1}{2}` is often inserted in the
denominator. The corresponding dimensionless number,

.. _Eq:_auto88:

.. math::

    \tag{229}
    \hbox{Eu} = \frac{p_{\infty} - p_v}{\frac{1}{2}\varrho U^2},
        
        

is called the *Euler number*. The pressure gradient term now reads
:math:`\frac{1}{2}\hbox{Eu}\,\bar\nabla\bar p`. The Euler number
expresses the ratio of pressure differences and the kinetic
energy of the flow.

.. _freesurface:Weber:

Free surface conditions and the Weber number
--------------------------------------------
At a free surface, :math:`z=\eta(x,y,t)`, the boundary conditions are

.. _Eq:_auto89:

.. math::

    \tag{230}
    w = \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\eta,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:surface_tension:

.. math::

    \tag{231}
    p - p_0  \approx
        -\sigma\left(\frac{\partial^2\eta}{\partial x^2} +
        \frac{\partial^2\eta}{\partial y^2}\right),
        
        

where :math:`w` is the velocity component in the :math:`z` direction,
:math:`p_0` is the atmospheric air pressure at the surface,
and :math:`\sigma` represents the surface tension.
The approximation in :ref:`(231) <Eq:scale:fluid:NS:surface_tension>` is valid
under small deformations of the surface.

.. index:: Weber number

The dimensionless form of these conditions starts with inserting the
dimensionless quantities in the equations:

.. math::
        
        u_c\bar w &= \frac{L}{t_c}
        \frac{\partial\bar\eta}{\partial\bar t} +
        u_c\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\eta,\\ 
        p_c \bar p &\approx
        -\frac{1}{L}\sigma\left(\frac{\partial^2\bar\eta}{\partial \bar x^2} +
        \frac{\partial^2\bar\eta}{\partial \bar y^2}\right){\thinspace .}
        

The characteristic length :math:`L` is usually taken as the depth of the fluid
when the surface is flat. We have used
:math:`\bar p = (p - p_0)/p_c` for making the pressure dimensionless.
Using :math:`u_c=U`, :math:`t_c=L/U`, and :math:`p_c = \varrho U^2`, results in

.. _Eq:_auto90:

.. math::

    \tag{232}
    \bar w = \frac{\partial\bar\eta}{\partial\bar t} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\eta,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:NS:surface_tension2:

.. math::

    \tag{233}
    \bar p \approx
        - \hbox{We}^{-1}\left(\frac{\partial^2\bar\eta}{\partial \bar x^2} +
        \frac{\partial^2\bar\eta}{\partial \bar y^2}\right),
        
        

where We is the *Weber number*,

.. _Eq:_auto91:

.. math::

    \tag{234}
    \hbox{We} = \frac{\varrho U^2L}{\sigma}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The Weber number measures the importance of surface tension effects and
is the ratio of the pressure scale :math:`\varrho U^2` and the surface
tension force per area, typically :math:`\sigma/R_x` in a 2D problem, which
has size :math:`\sigma/L`.

Thermal convection
==================

Temperature differences in fluid flow cause density differences, and since
cold fluid is heavier than hot fluid, the gravity force will induce
flow due to density differences. This effect is called free thermal
convection and is key to our weather and heating of rooms.
Forced convection refers to the case where there is no
feedback from the temperature field to the motion, i.e., temperature
differences do not create motion. This fact decouples the energy
equation from the mass and momentum equations.

.. _scale:fluid:forced_convection:

Forced convection
-----------------

.. index:: forced convection

.. index:: Peclet number

.. index:: Reynolds number

The model governing forced convection consists of the Navier-Stokes
equations and the energy equation for the temperature:

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:forced_convection:eq:momentum_T_forced:

.. math::

    \tag{235}
    \varrho\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}\right)
        = -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} - \varrho g\boldsymbol{k},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:forced_convection:eq:cont_T_forced:

.. math::

    \tag{236}
    \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}  = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:forced_convection:eq:energy_T_forced:

.. math::

    \tag{237}
    \varrho c\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla T\right)
        = \kappa\nabla^2 T{\thinspace .}
        
        

The symbol :math:`T` is the temperature, :math:`c` is a heat capacity, and :math:`\kappa`
is the heat conduction coefficient for the fluid. The PDE system
applies primarily for liquids. For gases one may need a term
:math:`- p\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}` for the pressure work in
:ref:`(237) <Eq:scale:fluid:forced_convection:eq:energy_T_forced>`
as well as a modified equation of continuity
:ref:`(236) <Eq:scale:fluid:forced_convection:eq:cont_T_forced>`.

Despite the fact that :math:`\varrho` depends on :math:`T`, we treat :math:`\varrho`
as a constant :math:`\varrho_0`. The major effect of the :math:`\varrho(T)`
dependence is through the
buoyancy effect caused by the gravity term :math:`-\varrho(T)g\boldsymbol{k}`.
It is common to drop this
term in forced convection,
and assume the momentum and continuity equations to be
independent of the temperature. The flow is driven by boundary
conditions (rather than density variations as in free convection),
from which we can find a characteristic velocity :math:`U`.

Dimensionless parameters are introduced as follows:

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{L},
        \ t_c = \frac{L}{U},\ 
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{u}}{U},\ \bar p = \frac{p}{\varrho_0 U^2},\ 
        \bar T = \frac{T-T_0}{T_c}{\thinspace .}

Other coordinates are also scaled by :math:`L`.
The characteristic temperature :math:`T_c` is chosen as some range :math:`\Delta T`,
which depends on the problem and is often given by the
thermal initial and/or
boundary conditions. The reference temperature :math:`T_0` is also
implied by prescribed conditions.
Inserted in the equations, we get

.. math::
        
        \varrho_0\frac{U^2}{L}\frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} +
        \varrho_0\frac{U^2}{L}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar \nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        &= -\frac{\varrho_0 U^2}{L}\bar\nabla \bar p + \frac{\mu U}{L^2}
        \bar \nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}},
        \\ 
        \frac{U}{L}\bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} & = 0,
        \\ 
        \varrho_0 c\left(\frac{T_c U}{L}
        \frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar t} +
        \frac{UT_c}{L}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla \bar T\right)
        &= \frac{\kappa T_c}{L^2}
        \bar \nabla^2 \bar T {\thinspace .}
        

Making each term in each equation dimensionless reduces the system to

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:forced_convection:eq:momentum_TB0:

.. math::

    \tag{238}
    \frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar{t}} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar{\nabla}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        = -\bar{\nabla}\bar{p} + \hbox{Re}^{-1}\bar{\nabla}^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:forced_convection:eq:cont_TB0:

.. math::

    \tag{239}
    \bar{\nabla}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}  = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:forced_convection:eq:energy_TB0:

.. math::

    \tag{240}
    \frac{\partial\bar{T}}{\partial\bar{t}} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar{\nabla}\bar{T}
        = \hbox{Pe}^{-1}
        \bar{\nabla}^2\bar{T}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The two dimensionless numbers in this system are given by

.. math::
        
        \hbox{Pe} = \frac{\varrho_0 c UL}{\kappa },\quad
        \hbox{Re} = \frac{UL}{\nu}\quad (\nu = \frac{\mu}{\varrho_0}){\thinspace .}
        

The Peclet number is here defined as the ratio of the
convection term for heat :math:`\varrho_0 c U\Delta T/L` and the
heat conduction term :math:`\kappa U/L^2`. The fraction
:math:`\kappa/(\varrho_0 c)` is known as the thermal diffusivity,
and if this quantity is given a symbol :math:`{\alpha}`, we realize the
relation to the Peclet number defined in the section :ref:`scale:convdiff`.

.. _scale:fluid:free_convection:

Free convection
---------------

.. index:: free convection

Governing equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mathematical model for free thermal convection
consists of the Navier-Stokes equations
coupled to an energy equation governing the temperature:

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:momentum_T:

.. math::

    \tag{241}
    \varrho\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}\right)
        = -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} - \varrho g\boldsymbol{k},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:cont_T:

.. math::

    \tag{242}
    \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\varrho\boldsymbol{u})  = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:energy_T:

.. math::

    \tag{243}
    \varrho c\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla T\right)
        = \kappa\nabla^2 T + 2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij},
        
        

where Einstein's summation convention is implied for the
:math:`\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}` term.
The symbol :math:`T` is the temperature, :math:`c` is a heat capacity, :math:`\kappa`
is the heat conduction coefficient for the fluid. In free convection,
the gravity term :math:`-\varrho(T) g\boldsymbol{k}` is essential since the flow is driven
by temperature differences and the fact that hot fluid rises while
cold fluid falls.

For a slightly compressible gas flow a term :math:`-p\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}` may be
needed in
:ref:`(243) <Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:energy_T>`.

Heating by viscous effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have also included heating of the fluid due to the work of viscous forces,
represented by the term :math:`2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}`, where
:math:`\varepsilon_{ij}` is the strain-rate tensor in the flow, defined by

.. math::
         \varepsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}
        + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right) = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\boldsymbol{u} + (\nabla\boldsymbol{u})^T),

where :math:`u_i` is the velocity in direction of :math:`x_i` (:math:`i=1,2,3` measures
the space directions). The term :math:`2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}`
is actually much
more relevant for forced convection, but was left out in the section :ref:`scale:fluid:forced_convection` for mathematical simplicity.
Heating by the work of viscous forces is often a very small effect and
can be neglected, although it plays a major role in forging and
extrusion of metals where the viscosity is very large (such
processes require large external forces to drive the flow).  The reason
for including the work by viscous forces under the heading
of free convection, is that we want to scale a more complete,
general mathematical model for mixed force and free convection, and
arrive at dimensionless numbers that can tell if this extra term is
important or not.

Relation between density and temperature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Equation :ref:`(241) <Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:momentum_T>` and has
already been made dimensionless in the previous section. The major
difference is now that :math:`\varrho` is no longer a constant, but a
function of :math:`T`.  The relationship between :math:`\varrho` and :math:`T` is often
taken as linear,

.. math::
         \varrho = \varrho_0 -\varrho_0 \beta (T-T_0),

where

.. math::
         \beta = -\frac{1}{\varrho}\left(\frac{\partial\varrho}{\partial t}
        \right)_p,

is known as the thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid,
and :math:`\varrho_0` is a reference density when the temperature is at :math:`T_0`.

The Boussinesq approximation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A very common approximation, called the *Boussinesq approximation*, is
to neglect the density variations in all terms except the gravity term.
This is a good approximation unless the change in :math:`\varrho` is large.
With the linear :math:`\varrho(T)` formula and the Boussinesq approximation,
:ref:`(241) <Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:momentum_T>`-:ref:`(243) <Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:energy_T>`
take the form

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:momentum_TB:

.. math::

    \tag{244}
    \varrho_0\left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}\right)
        = -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} - (\varrho_0 - \varrho_0\beta(T-T_0))g\boldsymbol{k},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:cont_TB:

.. math::

    \tag{245}
    \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}  = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:energy_TB:

.. math::

    \tag{246}
    \varrho_0 c\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla T\right)
        = \kappa\nabla^2 T + 2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}{\thinspace .}
        
        

A good justification of the Boussinesq approximation is provided
by Tritton [Ref09]_ (Ch. 13).

Scaling          (8)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dimensionless variables are introduced as

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\ \ t_c = \frac{L}{U},\ 
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{u}}{U},\ \bar p = \frac{p}{\varrho U^2},\ 
        \bar T = \frac{T-T_0}{\Delta T}{\thinspace .}

The dimensionless :math:`y` and :math:`z` coordinates also make use of :math:`L` as scale.
As in forced convection, we assume the characteristic temperature
level :math:`T_0` and the scale :math:`\Delta T` are given by thermal boundary and/or
initial conditions.
Contrary to the sections :ref:`sec:scale:ns` and :ref:`scale:fluid:forced_convection`,
:math:`U` is now not given by the problem description, but implied by
:math:`\Delta T`.

Replacing quantities with dimensions by their dimensionless counterparts
results in

.. math::
        
        \varrho_0\frac{U^2}{L}\frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} +
        \varrho_0\frac{U^2}{L}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar \nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        &= -\frac{p_c}{L}\bar\nabla \bar p + \frac{\mu U}{L^2}
        \bar \nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} - \varrho_0g\boldsymbol{k} + \varrho_0\beta T_c\bar T g\boldsymbol{k},
        \\ 
        \frac{U}{L}\bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} & = 0,
        \\ 
        \varrho_0 c\left(\frac{T_c U}{L}
        \frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar t} +
        \frac{UT_c}{L}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla \bar T\right)
        &= \frac{\kappa T_c}{L^2}
        \bar \nabla^2 \bar T + 2\frac{\mu U}{L}
        \bar\varepsilon_{ij}\bar\varepsilon_{ij}{\thinspace .}
        

These equations reduce to

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:momentum_TB0:

.. math::

    \tag{247}
    \frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar \nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        = -\bar\nabla \bar p + \hbox{Re}^{-1}\bar \nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        - \hbox{Fr}^{-2}\boldsymbol{k}  + \gamma \bar T\boldsymbol{k},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:cont_TB0:

.. math::

    \tag{248}
    \bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}  = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:energy_TB0:

.. math::

    \tag{249}
    \frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar t} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla \bar T
        = \hbox{Pe}^{-1}\bar \nabla^2 \bar T + 2\delta
        \bar\varepsilon_{ij}\bar\varepsilon_{ij}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The dimensionless numbers, in addition to Re and Fr, are

.. math::
        
        \gamma = \frac{g\beta L\Delta T }{U^2},\quad
        \hbox{Pe}^{-1} = \frac{\kappa }{\varrho_0 c UL},\quad
        \delta = \frac{\mu U}{L\varrho_0 c \Delta T}{\thinspace .}
        

The :math:`\gamma` number measures the ratio of thermal buoyancy and
the convection term:

.. math::
         \gamma = \frac{\varrho_0 g\beta \Delta T }{\varrho_0 U^2/L}
        = \frac{g\beta L\Delta T }{U^2}{\thinspace .}

The Pe parameter is the fraction of the convection term
and the thermal diffusion term:

.. math::
         \frac{|\varrho_0\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla T|}{|\kappa\nabla^2 T|}\sim
        \frac{\varrho_0 c U \Delta T L^{-1}}{\kappa L^{-2}\Delta T}
        = \frac{\varrho c UL}{\kappa } = \hbox{Pe}{\thinspace .}

The :math:`\delta` parameter is the ratio of the viscous dissipation term
and the convection term:

.. math::
         \frac{|\mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u}|}{|\varrho_0c\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla T|}\sim
        \frac{\mu U^2/L^2}{\varrho_0 c U \Delta T/L} =
        \frac{\mu U}{L\varrho_0 c \Delta T} = \delta{\thinspace .}
        

The Grashof, Prandtl, and Eckert numbers
----------------------------------------

.. index:: Grashof number

.. index:: Reynolds number

The problem with the above dimensionless numbers is that they involve
:math:`U`, but :math:`U` is implied by :math:`\Delta T`. Assuming that the convection
term is much bigger than the viscous diffusion term, the momentum
equation features a balance between the buoyancy term and the convection
term:

.. math::
         |\varrho_0 \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}| \sim \varrho_0 g \beta\Delta T{\thinspace .}

Translating this similarity to scales,

.. math::
         \varrho_0 U^2/L \sim \varrho_0 g \beta\Delta T,

gives an :math:`U` in terms of :math:`\Delta T` :

.. math::
         U = \sqrt{\beta L \Delta T}{\thinspace .}

The Reynolds number with this :math:`U` now becomes

.. math::
         \hbox{Re}_T = \frac{UL}{\nu} = \frac{\sqrt{g\beta L^3 \Delta T}}{\nu^2}
        = \hbox{Gr}^{1/2},

where Gr is the Grashof number in free thermal convection:

.. math::
         \hbox{Gr} = \hbox{Re}_T^2 =  \frac{g\beta L^3 \Delta T}{\nu^2}{\thinspace .}

The Grashof number replaces the Reynolds number in the scaled equations
of free thermal convection. We shall soon look at its interpretations,
which are not as straightforward as for the Reynolds and Peclet numbers.

The above
choice of :math:`U` in terms of :math:`\Delta T` results in :math:`\gamma` equal to unity:

.. math::
         \gamma = \frac{g\beta L\Delta T }{U^2} =
        \frac{g\beta L\Delta T }{g\beta L \Delta T} = 1{\thinspace .}

.. index:: Peclet number

The Peclet number can also be rewritten as

.. math::
         \hbox{Pe}= \frac{\varrho c UL}{\kappa } = \frac{\mu c}{\kappa}
        \frac{\varrho UL}{\mu}
        = \hbox{Pr}\hbox{Re}^{-1} = \hbox{Pr}\hbox{Re}_T^{-1},

where Pr is the Prandtl number, defined as

.. math::
         \hbox{Pr} = \frac{\mu c}{\kappa}{\thinspace .}

The Prandtl number is the ratio of the momentum diffusivity (kinematic
viscosity) and the thermal diffusivity. Actually, more detailed
analysis shows that Pr reflects the ratio of the thickness of the
thermal and velocity boundary layers: when :math:`\hbox{Pr}=1`, these layers
coincide, while :math:`\hbox{Pr}\ll 1` implies that the thermal layer is
much thicker than the velocity boundary layer, and vice versa for
:math:`\hbox{Pr}\gg 1`.

.. index:: Eckert number

The :math:`\delta` parameter is in free convection replaced by a combination
of the Eckert number (Ec) and the Reynolds number. We have that

.. math::
         \hbox{Ec} = \frac{U^2}{c\Delta T} = \delta\hbox{Re}_T,

and consequently

.. math::
         \delta = \hbox{Ec}\hbox{Re}_T^{-1} = \hbox{Ec}\hbox{Gr}^{-1/2}{\thinspace .}

Writing

.. math::
         \hbox{Ec} = \frac{\varrho_0U^2}{\varrho_0c\Delta T},

shows that the Eckert number can be interpreted as the ratio of
the kinetic energy of the flow and the thermal energy.

We use Gr instead of :math:`\hbox{Re}_T` in the momentum equations and also
instead of Pe in the energy equation (recall that :math:`\hbox{Pe} =
\hbox{Pr}\hbox{Re} =
\hbox{Pr}\hbox{Re}_T=\hbox{Pr}\hbox{Gr}^{-1/2}`). The resulting scaled
system becomes

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:momentum_TB1:

.. math::

    \tag{250}
    \frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar \nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        = -\bar\nabla \bar p + \hbox{Gr}^{-1/2}\bar \nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        - \hbox{Fr}^{-2}\boldsymbol{k}  + \bar T \boldsymbol{k},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:cont_TB1:

.. math::

    \tag{251}
    \bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}  = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:eq:energy_TB1:

.. math::

    \tag{252}
    \hbox{Gr}^{1/2}\left(\frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar t} +
        \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla \bar T\right)
        = \hbox{Pr}^{-1}
        \bar \nabla^2 \bar T + 2\hbox{Ec}\hbox{Gr}^{-1/2}
        \bar\varepsilon_{ij}\bar\varepsilon_{ij}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The Grashof number plays the same
role as the Reynolds number in the momentum equation in free
convection. In particular,
it turns out that Gr governs the transition between laminar and
turbulent flow.  For example, the transition to turbulence occurs in
the range :math:`10^8 < \hbox{Gr} < 10^9` for free convection from vertical
flat plates.  Gr is normally interpreted as a dimensionless number
expressing the ratio of buoyancy forces and viscous forces.

Interpretations of the Grashof number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recall that the scaling leading to the Grashof number is based on an
estimate of :math:`U` from a balance of the convective and the buoyancy
terms. When the viscous term dominates over convection, we need a
different estimate of :math:`U`, since in this case, the viscous force
balances the buoyancy force:

.. math::
         \mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} \sim \varrho_0g\beta\Delta T\quad
        \Rightarrow\quad \mu U/L^2 \sim \varrho_0g\beta\Delta T,

This similarity suggests the scale

.. math::
         U = \frac{g\beta L^2 \Delta T}{\nu}{\thinspace .}

Now,

.. math::
         \frac{|\varrho_0\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u}|}{|\mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u}|} \sim \frac{UL}{\nu}
        = \frac{g\beta L^3 \Delta T}{\nu} = \hbox{Gr}{\thinspace .}

The result means that :math:`\hbox{Gr}^{1/2}` measures the ratio of convection and
viscous forces when convection dominates, whereas Gr measures this ratio when
viscous forces dominate.

The product of Gr and Pr is the Rayleigh number,

.. math::
        
        \hbox{Ra} = \frac{g\beta L^3\Delta T\varrho_0 c}{\nu\kappa},
        

since

.. math::
        
        \hbox{Gr} \hbox{Pr} = \hbox{Re}_T^2\hbox{Pr} =
        \frac{g\beta L^3 \Delta T}{\nu^2}\frac{\mu c}{\kappa} =
        \frac{g\beta L^3 \Delta T\varrho_0 c}{\nu\kappa} =
        \hbox{Ra}{\thinspace .}
        

The Rayleigh number is the preferred dimensionless number when studying
free convection in horizontal layers [Ref10]_ [Ref09]_. Otherwise,
Gr and Pr are used.

Heat transfer at boundaries and the Nusselt and Biot numbers
------------------------------------------------------------

.. index:: Nusselt number

.. index:: Biot number

A common boundary condition, modeling heat transfer to/from the
surroundings, is

.. _Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:fluxcond:

.. math::

    \tag{253}
    -\kappa\frac{\partial T}{\partial n} = h(T - T_s),
        
        

where :math:`\partial/\partial n` means the derivative in the normal direction
(:math:`\boldsymbol{n}\cdot\nabla`), :math:`h` is an experimentally determined
heat transfer coefficient, and :math:`T_s` is the temperature of
the surroundings. Scaling :ref:`(253) <Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:fluxcond>`
leads to

.. math::
         -\frac{\kappa\Delta t}{L}\frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar n} = h(\Delta T \bar T + T_0 - T_s),

and further to

.. math::
         \frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar n} =
        \frac{hL}{\kappa}(\bar T + \frac{T_s - T_0}{\Delta T})
        = \delta(\bar T - \bar T_s),
        

where the dimensionless number :math:`\delta` is defined by

.. math::
         \delta = \frac{hL}{\kappa},

and :math:`\bar T_s` is simply the dimensionless surrounding temperature,

.. math::
         \bar T_s = \frac{T_s - T_0}{\Delta T}{\thinspace .}

When studying heat transfer in a fluid, with solid surroundings,
:math:`\delta` is known as the `Nusselt number <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusselt_number>`__ Nu.  The left-hand side
of :ref:`(253) <Eq:scale:fluid:free_convection:fluxcond>` represents in this case
heat conduction, while the right-hand side models convective heat
transfer at a boundary. The Nusselt number can then be interpreted as
the ratio of convective and conductive heat transfer at a solid
boundary:

.. math::
         \frac{|h(T-T_s)|}{\kappa T/L} \sim \frac{h}{\kappa /L} = \hbox{Nu}{\thinspace .}

The case with heat transfer in a solid with a fluid as surroundings
gives the same dimensionless :math:`\delta`, but the number is now known as
the `Biot number <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot_number>`__. It
describes the ratio of heat loss/gain with the surroundings at the
solid body's boundary and conduction inside the body. A small Biot
number indicates that conduction is a fast process and one can use
Newton's law of cooling (see the section :ref:`scale:cooling:const`)
instead of a detailed calculation of the
spatio-temporal temperature variation in the body.
The Biot number also arises in simplified models of heat conduction in solids,
see :ref:`scale:exer:twometal`.

Heat transfer is a huge engineering
field with lots of experimental investigations
that are summarized by curves relating various dimensionless numbers
such as Gr, Pr, Nu, and Bi.

.. _scale:gasdyn:

Compressible gas dynamics
=========================

.. _scale:Euler_eqs:

The Euler equations of gas dynamics
-----------------------------------

The fundamental equations for a compressible fluid are based on balance
of mass, momentum, and energy. When molecular diffusion effects are
negligible, the PDE system, known as the Euler
equations of gas dynamics, can be written as

.. _Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:mass:

.. math::

    \tag{254}
    \frac{\partial\varrho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\varrho\boldsymbol{u}) = 0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:mom:

.. math::

    \tag{255}
    \frac{\partial(\varrho\boldsymbol{u})}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\varrho\boldsymbol{u}\boldsymbol{u}^T) = -\nabla p + \varrho \boldsymbol{f},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:energy:

.. math::

    \tag{256}
    \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\boldsymbol{u}(E+p)) = 0,
        
        

with :math:`E` being

.. _Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:E:

.. math::

    \tag{257}
    E = \varrho e + \frac{1}{2}\varrho\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}{\thinspace .}
        
        

In these equations, :math:`\boldsymbol{u}` is the fluid velocity, :math:`\varrho` is the density,
:math:`p` is the pressure, :math:`E` is the total energy per unit volume, composed
of the kinetic energy per unit volume, :math:`\frac{1}{2}\varrho \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}`, and the
internal energy per unit volume, :math:`\varrho e`.

Assuming the fluid to be an ideal gas implies the following additional
relations:

.. _Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:e:

.. math::

    \tag{258}
    e = c_v T,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:p:

.. math::

    \tag{259}
    p = \varrho RT = \frac{R}{c_v}(E-\frac{1}{2}\varrho \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}),
        
        

where :math:`c_v` is the specific heat capacity at constant volume (for dry air
:math:`c_v = 717.5\, \hbox{J}\,\hbox{kg}^{-1}\hbox{K}^{-1}`),
:math:`R` is the specific ideal gas constant
(:math:`R=287.14 \hbox{J}\hbox{kg}^{-1}\hbox{K}^{-1}`), and :math:`T` is the temperature.

The common way to solve these equations is to propagate :math:`\varrho`,
:math:`\varrho\boldsymbol{u}`, and :math:`E` by an explicit numerical method in time for
:ref:`(254) <Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:mass>`-:ref:`(256) <Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:energy>`,
using :ref:`(259) <Eq:scale:Euler_eqs:p>` for :math:`p`.

We introduce dimensionless independent variables,

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad \bar y = \frac{y}{L},\quad \bar z = \frac{z}{L},
        \quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},

and dimensionless dependent variables,

.. math::
         \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{u}}{U},\quad\bar\varrho = \frac{\varrho}{\varrho_c},
        \quad\bar p = \frac{p}{p_c},\quad \bar E= \frac{E}{E_c}{\thinspace .}

Inserting these expressions in the governing equations gives

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial\bar{\varrho}}{\partial\bar{t}} +
        \frac{t_c U}{L}\bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) &= 0,\\ 
        \frac{\partial(\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}})}{\partial\bar{t}} +
        \frac{t_cU}{L}\bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}^T) &=-
        \frac{t_cp_c}{UL\varrho_c}\nabla\bar{p} + \frac{t_c f_c}{U}\bar{\varrho}
        \bar{\boldsymbol{f}},\\ 
        \frac{\partial\bar E}{\partial\bar{t}} +
        \frac{t_c U}{LE_c }\bar{\nabla}\cdot(\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}(E_c\bar{E}+p_c\bar{p})) &= 0,\\ 
        \bar{p} & = \frac{R}{c_v p_c}(E_c\bar{E} -
        \frac{1}{2}\varrho_cu_c\bar{\varrho}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}){\thinspace .}
        

A natural choice of time scale is :math:`t_c=L/U`. A common choice of
pressure scale is :math:`p_c=\varrho_c U^2`. The energy equation simplifies if
we choose :math:`E_c=p_c=\varrho_c U^2`. With these scales we get

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial\bar\varrho}{\partial\bar t} +
        \bar\nabla\cdot(\bar\varrho\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) &= 0,\\ 
        \frac{\partial(\bar\varrho\bar{\boldsymbol{u}})}{\partial\bar t} +
        \bar\nabla\cdot(\bar\varrho\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}^T) &=
        -\nabla\bar p + \alpha\bar\varrho \bar{\boldsymbol{f}},\\ 
        \frac{\partial\bar E}{\partial\bar t} +
        \bar\nabla\cdot(\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}(\bar E+ \bar p)) &= 0,\\ 
        \bar p & = \frac{R}{c_v}(\bar E - \frac{1}{2}\bar\varrho\bar u\cdot\bar u),
        

where :math:`\alpha` is a dimensionless number:

.. math::
         \alpha = \frac{Lf_c}{U^2}{\thinspace .}

We realize that the scaled Euler equations look like
the ones with dimension, apart from the :math:`\alpha` coefficient.

General isentropic flow
-----------------------

Heat transfer can be neglected in
`isentropic flow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isentropic_process>`__,
and there is hence an equation of state involving only :math:`\varrho` and
:math:`p`:

.. math::
         p = F(\varrho){\thinspace .}

The energy equation is now not needed and the Euler equations simplify
to

.. _Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:rho:

.. math::

    \tag{260}
    \frac{\partial\varrho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\boldsymbol{u}\varrho) =0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u:

.. math::

    \tag{261}
    \varrho\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \varrho\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} + \nabla p =0{\thinspace .}
        
        

Elimination of the pressure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common equation of state is

.. math::
         F(\varrho) = p_0\left(\frac{\varrho}{\varrho_0}\right)^\gamma,

where :math:`\gamma = 5/3` for air. The first step is to eliminate :math:`p` in
favor of :math:`\varrho` so we get a system for :math:`\varrho` and :math:`\boldsymbol{u}`.
To this end, we must calculate :math:`\nabla p`:

.. math::
         \nabla p = F'(\varrho)\nabla\varrho,\quad
        F'(\varrho)= c_0^2\left(\frac{\varrho}{\varrho_0}\right)^{\gamma-1},

where

.. math::
         c_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma p_0}{\varrho_0}}

is the speed of sound within the fluid in the equilibrium state (see the subsequent section).
Equation :ref:`(261) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u>` with eliminated pressure :math:`p` reads

.. _Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u2:

.. math::

    \tag{262}
    \varrho\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \varrho\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} +
        c_0^2\left(\frac{\varrho}{\varrho_0}\right)^{\gamma-1}\nabla\varrho =0{\thinspace .}
        
        

The governing equations are now :ref:`(260) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:rho>`
and :ref:`(262) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u2>`.
Space and time are scaled in the usual way as

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad\bar y = \frac{y}{L},\quad\bar z = \frac{z}{L},
        \quad\bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}{\thinspace .}

The scaled dependent variables are

.. math::
         \bar\varrho = \frac{\varrho}{\varrho_c},\quad \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{u}}{U}{\thinspace .}

Then :math:`F'(\varrho)=c_0^2\bar\varrho^{\gamma-1}`.

Inserting the dimensionless variables in the two governing PDEs leads to

.. math::
        
        \frac{\varrho_c}{t_c}\frac{\partial\bar\varrho}{\partial\bar t}
        + \frac{\varrho_c U}{L}\bar\nabla\cdot(\bar\varrho\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) &=0,\\ 
        \frac{\varrho_c U}{t_c}\bar\varrho
        \frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar t} +
        \frac{\varrho_c U^2}{L}\bar\varrho\bar u\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        + \frac{\varrho_c}{L}\left(\frac{\varrho_c}{\varrho_0}\right)^{\gamma-1}c_0^2\bar\varrho^{\gamma-1}
        \bar\nabla\bar\varrho
        &=0{\thinspace .}
        

The characteristic flow velocity is :math:`U` so a natural time scale is
:math:`t_c = L/U`. This choice leads to the scaled PDEs

.. _Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:isentropic:cont:s:

.. math::

    \tag{263}
    \frac{\partial\bar\varrho}{\partial\bar t}
        + \bar\nabla\cdot(\bar\varrho\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) =0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:isentropic:mom:s:

.. math::

    \tag{264}
    \bar\varrho
        \frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar t} +
        \bar\varrho\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        + \hbox{M}^{-2}\left(\frac{\varrho_c}{\varrho_0}\right)^{\gamma-1}\bar\varrho^{\gamma-1}
        \bar\nabla\bar\varrho
        =0,
        
        

where the dimensionless number

.. math::
         \hbox{M} = \frac{U}{c_0},

is known as the *Mach number*.
The boundary conditions specify the characteristic velocity :math:`U` and
thereby the Mach number. Observe that :ref:`(264) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:isentropic:mom:s>`
simplifies if :math:`\varrho_c=\varrho_0` is an appropriate choice.

The acoustic approximation for sound waves
------------------------------------------

Wave nature of isentropic flow with small perturbations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A model for sound waves can be based on :ref:`(260) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:rho>`
and :ref:`(262) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u2>`, but in this case
there are small pressure, velocity, and
density *perturbations* from a ground state at rest
where :math:`\boldsymbol{u}=0`, :math:`\varrho=\varrho_0`, and :math:`p=p_0 = F(\varrho_0)`.
Introducing the perturbations :math:`\hat\varrho = \varrho - \varrho_0` and
:math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}`,
:ref:`(260) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:rho>`
and :ref:`(262) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u2>` take the form

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial\hat\varrho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}(\varrho_0 + \hat\varrho) &=0,\\ 
        (\varrho_0 + \hat\varrho)
        \frac{\partial\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial t} + (\varrho_0+\hat\varrho)\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\nabla\hat{\boldsymbol{u}} +
        c_0^2\left(1 + \frac{\hat\varrho}{\varrho_0}\right)^{\gamma-1}\nabla\hat\varrho &=0{\thinspace .}
        

For small perturbations we can linearize this PDE system by
neglecting all products of :math:`\hat\varrho` and
:math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}`. Also, :math:`1 + \hat\varrho/\varrho_0\approx 1`.
This leaves us with the simplified system

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial\hat\varrho}{\partial t} + \varrho_0\nabla\cdot\hat{\boldsymbol{u}} &=0,\\ 
        \varrho_0\frac{\partial\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial t} +
        c_0^2\nabla\hat\varrho &=0{\thinspace .}
        

Eliminating :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}` by differentiating the first PDE with respect to :math:`t`
and taking the divergence of the second PDE gives a standard wave equation
for the density perturbations:

.. math::
         \frac{\partial^2\hat\varrho}{\partial t^2} = c_0^2\nabla^2\hat\varrho{\thinspace .}

Similarly, :math:`\hat\varrho` can be eliminated and one gets a wave equation for
:math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}`, also with wave velocity :math:`c_0`.
This means that the sound perturbations travel with velocity :math:`c_0`.

Basic scaling for small wave perturbations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let :math:`\varrho_c` and
:math:`u_c` be characteristic sizes of the perturbations in density and velocity.
The density will then vary in :math:`[\varrho_0-\varrho_c,\varrho_0+\varrho_c]`.
An appropriate scaling is

.. math::
         \bar\varrho =\frac{\varrho - \varrho_0}{\varrho_c} 

such that :math:`\bar\varrho\in [-1,1]`. Consequently,

.. math::
         \varrho = \varrho_0 + \varrho_c\bar\varrho = \varrho_0(1 + \alpha\bar\varrho),\quad \alpha = \frac{\varrho_c}{\varrho_0}{\thinspace .}

Note that the dimensionless :math:`\alpha` is expected to be a very small number
since :math:`\varrho_c\ll \varrho_0`.
The velocity, space, and time are scaled as in the previous
section.
Also note that :math:`\varrho_0` and :math:`p_0` are known values, but the scales
:math:`\varrho_c` and :math:`U` are not known. Usually these
can be estimated from perturbations (i.e., sound generation)
applied at the boundary.

Inserting the scaled variables in :ref:`(260) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:rho>`
and :ref:`(262) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u2>` results in

.. math::
        
        \alpha\frac{\varrho_0}{t_c}\frac{\partial\bar\varrho}{\partial\bar t}
        + \frac{\varrho_0 U}{L}\bar\nabla\cdot((1+\alpha\bar\varrho)\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) &=0,\\ 
        \frac{\varrho_0 U}{t_c}(1 + \alpha\bar\varrho)
        \frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar t} +
        \frac{\varrho_0 U^2}{L}(1 + \alpha\bar\varrho)\bar u\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}
        + \alpha\frac{\varrho_0}{L}c_0^2\left(1 + \alpha\bar\varrho\right)^{\gamma-1}
        \bar\nabla\bar\varrho
        &=0{\thinspace .}
        

Since we now model sound waves, the relevant time scale is not :math:`L/U`
but the time it takes a wave to travel through the domain: :math:`t_c=L/c_0`.
This is a much smaller time scale than in the previous section because
:math:`c_0\gg U`
(think of humans speaking: the sound travels very fast but one cannot feel
the corresponding very small flow perturbation in the air!).
Using :math:`t_c=L/u_0` we get

.. math::
        
        \alpha \frac{\partial\bar\varrho}{\partial\bar t}
        + \hbox{M}\bar\nabla\cdot((1+\alpha\bar\varrho)\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) &=0,\\ 
        (1 + \alpha\bar\varrho)
        \frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar t} +
        \hbox{M}(1 + \alpha\bar\varrho)\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} +
        \alpha\hbox{M}^{-1}\left(1 + \alpha \bar\varrho\right)^{\gamma-1}\bar\nabla\bar\varrho
        &=0{\thinspace .}
        

For small perturbations the linear terms in these equations must balance.
This points to :math:`M` and :math:`\alpha` being of the same order and we may
choose :math:`\alpha=M` (implying :math:`\varrho_c = \varrho_0\hbox{M}`) to obtain

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial\bar\varrho}{\partial\bar t}
        +\bar\nabla\cdot((1+\hbox{M}\bar\varrho)\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}) &=0,\\ 
        \frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar t} +
        \hbox{M}\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} +
        \left(1 + \hbox{M} \bar\varrho\right)^{\gamma-2}\bar\nabla\bar\varrho
        &=0{\thinspace .}
        

Now the Mach number,  :math:`\hbox{M}`, appears in the nonlinear terms only.
Letting :math:`\hbox{M}\rightarrow 0` we arrive at the following linearized system of PDEs

.. _Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:rho:s:

.. math::

    \tag{265}
    \frac{\partial\bar\varrho}{\partial\bar t}
        + \bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} =0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u2:s:

.. math::

    \tag{266}
    \frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar t} + \bar\nabla\bar\varrho =0,
        
        

The velocity :math:`\boldsymbol{u}` can be eliminated by taking the time derivative of
:ref:`(265) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:rho:s>` and the divergence of
:ref:`(266) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u2:s>`:

.. _Eq:_auto92:

.. math::

    \tag{267}
    \frac{\partial^2\bar\varrho}{\partial\bar t^2} =
        \bar\nabla^2\bar\varrho,
        
        

which is nothing but a standard dimensionless wave equation with
unit wave velocity. Similarly,
we can eliminate :math:`\varrho` by taking the divergence of
:ref:`(265) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:rho:s>` and the time derivative of
:ref:`(266) <Eq:scale:gas:acoustic:u2:s>`:

.. _Eq:_auto93:

.. math::

    \tag{268}
    \frac{\partial^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial\bar t^2} =
        \bar\nabla^2\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

We also observe that there are no physical parameters in the scaled
wave equations.

.. _scale:surfacewaves:

Water surface waves driven by gravity
=====================================

.. _scale:surfacewaves:Eulereq:

The mathematical model          (1)
-----------------------------------

Provided the Weber number (see the section :ref:`freesurface:Weber`) is
sufficiently small, capillary effects may be omitted and water surface waves are
governed by gravity.  For large Reynolds numbers, viscous effects
may also be ignored (except in boundary layers close to the bottom or
the surface of the fluid). The flow of an incompressible homogeneous
fluid under these assumptions
is governed by the Euler equations of motion on the form

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewaves:cont:

.. math::

    \tag{269}
    \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} =0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:u:

.. math::

    \tag{270}
    \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} + \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p +g\mathbf{k}=0{\thinspace .}
        
        

When the free surface position is described as
:math:`z=\eta(x,y,t)`, with :math:`z` as the vertical coordinate, the boundary conditions
at the surface read

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewaves:dynsurf:

.. math::

    \tag{271}
    p =p_s,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:kinsurf:

.. math::

    \tag{272}
    \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\eta =w,
        
        

where :math:`p_s` is the external pressure applied to the surface. At the
bottom, :math:`z=-h(x,y)`, there is the no-flux condition

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:kinbott:

.. math::

    \tag{273}
    \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}u+\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}v =-w{\thinspace .}
        

In addition to :math:`\rho` and  :math:`g` we assume that a typical depth :math:`h_c`,
a typical wavelength :math:`\lambda_c`, and a typical surface elevation :math:`A`, which
then by definition is a scale for :math:`\eta`, are
the given parameters. From these we must derive scales for the coordinates, the velocity components, and the pressure.

Scaling          (9)
--------------------

First, it is instructive to define a typical wave celerity, :math:`c_c`, which
must be linked to the length and time scale according to :math:`c_c=\lambda_c/t_c`.
Since there is no other given parameter that matches the mass dimension of
:math:`\rho`, we express :math:`c_c` in terms of :math:`A`, :math:`\lambda_c`, :math:`h_c`, and :math:`g`.
Most of the work on waves in any discipline of physics is devoted to linear
or weakly nonlinear waves, and the wave celerity must be presumed to remain
finite as :math:`A` goes to zero (see, for instance, the section :ref:`scale:gas:acoustic`).
Hence, we may assume  that :math:`c_c` must depend on :math:`g` and either :math:`h_c` or :math:`\lambda_c`. Next, the two horizontal directions are equivalent with regard to
scaling, implying that
we have a common velocity scale, :math:`U`, for :math:`u` and :math:`v`, a common length scale :math:`L`
for :math:`x` and :math:`y`. The obvious choice for :math:`L` is :math:`\lambda_c`, while
the "vertical quantities" :math:`w` and :math:`z` have scales :math:`W` and :math:`Z`, respectively, which may differ from the horizontal counterparts.
However, we assume that also the length scale :math:`Z` remains finite
as :math:`A\rightarrow 0` and hence is independent of :math:`A`. This is less
obvious for :math:`Z` than for :math:`c_c` and :math:`t_c`, but may eventually
be confirmed by the existence
of linear solutions when solving the equation set.
From the linear part of :ref:`(272) <Eq:scale:surfacewave:kinsurf>` and :ref:`(269) <Eq:scale:surfacewaves:cont>` we obtain two relations between velocity and coordinate scales by demanding the non-dimensionalized terms to be of order unity

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewaves:scalrelations:

.. math::

    \tag{274}
    \frac{A}{t_c} = W,\quad \frac{U}{L}=\frac{W}{Z}{\thinspace .}
        

These relations are indeed useful, but they do not suffice to establish the scaling.

The pressure may be regarded as the sum of a large equilibrium part, balancing
gravity, and a much smaller dynamic part associated with the presence of
waves. To make the latter appear in the equations we define the
dynamic pressure, :math:`p_d`, according to

.. math::
         p=p_s-\rho g z +p_d,

and the pressure scale :math:`p_c=\rho g A` for :math:`p_d` then follows directly from
the surface condition :ref:`(271) <Eq:scale:surfacewaves:dynsurf>`.

The equation set will be scaled according to

.. math::
        
        \bar t=\frac{t}{t_c},\ \bar x=\frac{x}{L},\ \bar y =\frac{y}{L},\ \bar z =\frac{z}{Z},\ \bar \eta=\frac{\eta}{A},\ \bar u=\frac{u}{U},\ \bar v=\frac{v}{U},\ \bar w=\frac{w}{W},\ \bar p_d=\frac{p_d}{p_c}{\thinspace .}
        

In the further development of the scaling
we focus on two limiting cases, namely deep and shallow water.

Waves in deep  water
--------------------

Deep water means that :math:`h_c\gg\lambda_c`. Presumably the waves will not
feel the bottom, and :math:`h` as well as :math:`h_c` are removed from our
equations. The bottom boundary condition is replaced by a requirement
of vanishing velocity as :math:`z\rightarrow -\infty`. Consequently, :math:`c_c`
must depend upon :math:`\lambda_c` and :math:`g`, leaving us with
:math:`c_c=\sqrt{g\lambda_c}` and :math:`Z=\lambda_c=L` as the only options.
Then, :math:`t_c=\sqrt{\lambda_c/g}` and
:ref:`(274) <Eq:scale:surfacewaves:scalrelations>` implies
:math:`U=W=c_0\frac{A}{\lambda_c}=\epsilon c_0`, where we have introduced
the non-dimensional number

.. math::
        \epsilon=\frac{A}{\lambda_c},

which is the wave steepness. The equality of the horizontal and the vertical
scale is consistent with the common knowledge that the particle orbits in
deep water surface waves are circular.

The scaled equations are now expressed with :math:`\epsilon` as sole dimensionless
number

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewaves:cont::

.. math::

    \tag{275}
    \bar \nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} =0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:u:s:

.. math::

    \tag{276}
    \frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}}{\partial \bar t} + \epsilon\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar{\boldsymbol{u}} + \bar\nabla \bar p_d=0{\thinspace .}
        
        

The surface conditions, at :math:`z=\epsilon \eta`, become

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewaves:dynsurf:s:

.. math::

    \tag{277}
    \bar p_d =\bar \eta,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:kinsurf:s:

.. math::

    \tag{278}
    \frac{\partial\bar\eta}{\partial \bar t} + \epsilon \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\eta =\bar w,
        
        

while the bottom condition is replaced by

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:kinbott2:

.. math::

    \tag{279}
    \bar{\boldsymbol{u}} \rightarrow 0,
        

as :math:`\bar z \rightarrow -\infty`.

Long waves in shallow water
---------------------------

Long waves imply that the wavelength is large
compared to the depth: :math:`\lambda_c\gg h_c`. In analogy with the reasoning
above, we presume that the speed of the waves remains finite as
:math:`\lambda_c\rightarrow \infty`.  Then, :math:`c_c` must be based on :math:`g` and
:math:`h_c`, which leads to :math:`c_c=\sqrt{gh_c}` and
:math:`t_c=\lambda_c/\sqrt{gh_c}`. The natural choice for the vertical
length scale is now the depth; :math:`Z=h_c`.  Application of
:ref:`(274) <Eq:scale:surfacewaves:scalrelations>` then leads to :math:`W=c_c A/\lambda_c`
and :math:`U=c_c A/h_c`.

Introducing the dimensionless numbers

.. math::
         \alpha=\frac{A}{h_c},\quad \mu=\frac{h_c}{\lambda_c},

we rewrite the velocity scales as

.. math::
         W=\mu\alpha c_c,\quad U=\alpha c_c{\thinspace .}

We observe that :math:`W\ll U` for shallow water and that particle orbits must be elongated in the horizontal direction.

The equation set is now most transparently written by introducing the
horizontal velocity :math:`\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h=\bar u\mathbf{i}+\bar v\mathbf{j}`
and the corresponding horizontal components of the gradient operator, :math:`\bar\nabla_h`:

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewaves:contskalert:

.. math::

    \tag{280}
    \bar \nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h +\frac{\partial \bar w}{\partial \bar z}=0,
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto94:

.. math::

    \tag{281}
    \frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h}{\partial \bar t} + \alpha\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h\cdot\bar\nabla_h\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h+\alpha \bar w \frac{\partial \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h}{\partial \bar z} + \bar\nabla_h \bar p_d=0,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:uh:

.. math::

    \tag{282}
    \mu^2\left(\frac{\partial\bar{\boldsymbol{w}}}{\partial \bar t} +
        \alpha\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h\cdot\bar{\nabla}_h\bar{\boldsymbol{w}} +
        \alpha \bar{\boldsymbol{w}} \frac{\partial\bar{w}}{\partial\bar{z}}\right) +
        \frac{\partial\bar{p}_d}{\partial\bar{z}}=0.{\thinspace .}
        
        

Surface conditions, at :math:`z=\alpha \eta`, now become

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewaves:dynsurf:s2:

.. math::

    \tag{283}
    \bar p_d =\bar \eta,
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:kinsurf:s2:

.. math::

    \tag{284}
    \frac{\partial\bar\eta}{\partial \bar t} + \alpha \bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h\cdot\bar\nabla_h\bar\eta =\bar w,
        
        

while the bottom condition is invariant with respect to the present scaling

.. _Eq:scale:surfacewave:kinbott3:

.. math::

    \tag{285}
    \bar\nabla_h\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{u}}_h =-\bar w{\thinspace .}
        

An immediate consequence is that :math:`\bar p_d` remains equal to :math:`\bar \eta` throughout the water column when :math:`\mu^2\rightarrow 0`, which implies that the pressure
is hydrostatic. The above set of equations is a common  starting point for
perturbation expansions in :math:`\epsilon` and :math:`\mu^2` that lead to shallow water,
KdV, and Boussinesq type equations.

Two-phase porous media flow
===========================

We consider the flow of two incompressible, immiscible fluids in
a porous medium with porosity :math:`\phi (\boldsymbol{x})`. The two fluids are referred to
as the `wetting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetting>`__ and
non-wetting fluid. In an oil-water mixture, water is usually the
wetting fluid. The fraction of the pore volume occupied by the
wetting fluid is denoted by :math:`S(\boldsymbol{x},t)`. The non-wetting fluid then occupies
:math:`1-S` of the pore volume (or :math:`(1-S)\phi` of the total volume).
The variable :math:`P(\boldsymbol{x},t)` represents the pressure in the non-wetting fluid.
It is related to the pressure :math:`P_n` in the non-wetting fluid through
the capillary pressure :math:`p_c=P_n-P`, which is an empirically determined
function of :math:`S`.

From mass conservation of the two fluids and from Darcy's law for
each fluid, one can derive the following system of PDEs and
algebraic relations that govern the two primary unknowns :math:`S` and :math:`P`:

.. _Eq:scale:twoph:Peq:

.. math::

    \tag{286}
    \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{v} = -(Q_n + Q_w),
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:twoph:v_teq:

.. math::

    \tag{287}
    \boldsymbol{v} = -\lambda_t\nabla P + \lambda_wp_c'(S)\nabla S + (\lambda_w\varrho_w
        + \lambda_n\varrho_n)g\boldsymbol{k},
        
        

.. math::

The permeability of the porous medium is :math:`K`
(usually a tensor, but here taken as a
scalar for simplicity); :math:`\mu_w` and :math:`\mu_n` are the dynamic viscosities
of the wetting and non-wetting fluid, respectively;
:math:`\varrho_w` and :math:`\varrho_n` are the densities
of the wetting and non-wetting fluid, respectively;
:math:`q_w` and :math:`q_n` are the injection rates of the wetting and non-wetting
fluid through wells, respectively;
:math:`S_{wr}` is the irreducible saturation of
the wetting fluid (i.e., :math:`S\geq S_{wr}`); :math:`S_{nr}` is the corresponding
irreducible saturation of the non-wetting fluid (i.e., :math:`(1-S)\geq S_{nr}`),
:math:`K_{wn}` and :math:`K_{nr}` are the maximum values of the
relative permeabilities :math:`k_{rw}` and :math:`k_{rn}`, respectively, and
:math:`a` and :math:`b` are given (Corey) exponents in the expressions for the
relative permeabilities.

The two PDEs are of elliptic and hyperbolic/parabolic nature:
:ref:`(286) <Eq:scale:twoph:Peq>` is elliptic since it is the divergence of a
vector field, while :ref:`(288) <Eq:scale:twoph:Seq>` is parabolic (:math:`h_w\geq 0`
because :math:`p_c'(S)\geq 0` and :math:`\lambda_n` as well as :math:`f_w` are positive
since :math:`k_{rn}>0` and :math:`k_{rw}>0`). Very often, :math:`p_c'` is small so
:ref:`(288) <Eq:scale:twoph:Seq>` is of hyperbolic nature, and :math:`S` features very
steep gradients that become shocks in the limit :math:`p_c'\rightarrow 0`
and :ref:`(288) <Eq:scale:twoph:Seq>` is purely hyperbolic.
A popular solution technique is based on operator splitting at each
time level in a numerical scheme:
:ref:`(286) <Eq:scale:twoph:Peq>` is solved with respect to :math:`P`, given :math:`S`, and
:ref:`(288) <Eq:scale:twoph:Seq>` is solved with respect to :math:`S`, given :math:`P`.

The saturation :math:`S` is a non-dimensional quantity, and so are :math:`\phi`,
:math:`k_{rw}`, :math:`k_{rn}`, :math:`K_{wm}`, :math:`K_{nm}`, :math:`f_w`, and :math:`f_w'`.
The quantity :math:`\boldsymbol{v}` is the total filtration velocity, i.e., the
sum of the velocities of the wetting and non-wetting fluid.
An associated velocity scale :math:`v_c` is convenient to define.
It is also convenient to introduce dimensionless fractions of
wetting and non-wetting fluid properties:

.. math::
        
        \varrho &\equiv \varrho_w,\\ 
        \varrho_n &= \varrho\alpha,\quad \alpha = \frac{\varrho_n}{\varrho_w},\\ 
        \mu &\equiv\mu_w,\\ 
        \mu_n &= \mu\beta,\quad \beta = \frac{\mu_n}{\mu_w},\\ 
        Q &\equiv Q_w = \frac{q_w}{\varrho},\\ 
        Q_n &= Q\frac{\gamma}{\alpha},\quad \gamma = \frac{q_n}{q_w}{\thinspace .}
        

We will benefit from making :math:`\lambda_w`, :math:`\lambda_n`, and :math:`\lambda_t`
dimensionless:

.. math::
        
        \lambda_w(S) &= \frac{K}{\mu}k_{rw}(S) = \lambda_c\bar\lambda_w,\quad
        \lambda_c=\frac{K}{\mu},\quad \bar\lambda_w = k_{rw},\\ 
        \lambda_n(S) &= \frac{K}{\mu}\beta^{-1}k_{rn}(S) = \lambda_c\beta^{-1}\bar\lambda_n,
        \quad\bar\lambda_n = k_{rn},\\ 
        \lambda_t(S) &= \lambda_w(S) + \lambda_n(S) = \lambda_c\bar\lambda_t,\quad
        \bar\lambda_t = \bar \lambda_w +
        \beta^{-1}\bar\lambda_n{\thinspace .}
        

As we see, :math:`\lambda_c` is the characteristic size of any "lambda"
quantity, and a bar indicates as always a dimensionless variable.
The above formulas imply

.. math::
         h_w(S) = -\lambda_c\beta^{-1}\bar\lambda_n(S)f_w(S),\quad
        G_w(S) = h_w(S)\varrho(\alpha - 1){\thinspace .}

Furthermore, we introduce dimensionless quantities by

.. math::
         \bar{\boldsymbol{x}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{L},\quad \bar{\boldsymbol{v}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{v}}{v_c},\quad
        \bar{P} = \frac{P}{P_c},\quad\bar{p}_c = \frac{p_c}{P_c}{\thinspace .}

Inserting the above scaled quantities in the governing PDEs results in

.. _Eq:scale:twoph:Peq:s0:

.. math::

    \tag{299}
    \bar\nabla\cdot\bar{\boldsymbol{v}} = -\frac{LQ}{v_c}(1 + \alpha^{-1}\gamma),
        
        

.. math::
          
        \bar{\boldsymbol{v}} = -\frac{P_c\lambda_c}{v_c L}\bar\lambda_t\bar\nabla\bar P +
        \frac{\lambda_c P_c}{v_c L}\bar{\lambda}_w \bar{p}_c'(S)\bar\nabla S +
        \nonumber

.. math::
          
        \phi\frac{\partial S}{\partial\bar t} + \frac{t_cv_c}{L}f_w'(S)\bar{\boldsymbol{v}}\cdot
        \bar\nabla S =
        \frac{t_c P_c\lambda_c}{L^2}
        \bar\nabla\cdot(-\beta^{-1}\bar{\lambda}_n(S)f_w(S)\bar p_c'(S)\bar\nabla S) +
        \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:scale:twoph:Seq:s0:

.. math::

    \tag{301}
    \quad\quad \frac{t_c g}{L}\frac{\partial G_w}{\partial\bar z} + t_c f_w Q(1+\alpha^{-1}\gamma) - t_cQ{\thinspace .}
        
        

As usual, :math:`L` is taken as the characteristic length of the spatial domain.
Since :math:`v_c` is a velocity scale, a natural time scale is the time it
takes to transport a signal with velocity :math:`v_c` through the domain:
:math:`t_c = L/v_c`. The diffusion term in the equation
:ref:`(304) <Eq:scale:twoph:Seq:s>` then gets
a dimensionless fraction

.. math::
         \frac{L P_c\lambda_c}{v_c L^2}{\thinspace .}

Forcing this fraction to be unity gives

.. math::
         v_c = \lambda_c\frac{P_c}{L}{\thinspace .}

We realize that this is indeed a natural velocity scale if the
velocity is given by the pressure term in Darcy's law. This term
is :math:`K/\mu` times the pressure gradient:

.. math::
         \frac{K}{\mu}|\nabla P| \sim \frac{K}{\mu}\frac{P_c}{L} =
        \lambda_c\frac{P_c}{L} = v_c{\thinspace .}

We have here dropped the impact of the
relative permeabilities :math:`\bar\lambda_w` or
:math:`\bar\lambda_n` since these are quantities that are less than or equal
to unity.

The other term in Darcy's law is the gravity term that goes like
:math:`\lambda_c \varrho g` (again dropping relative permeabilities).
The ratio of the gravity term and the pressure gradient term in Darcy's
law is an interesting dimensionless number:

.. math::
         \delta = \frac{\lambda_c \varrho g}{\lambda_c P_c/L} =
        \frac{L\varrho g}{P_c}{\thinspace .}

This number naturally arises when we discuss
the term

.. math::
         \frac{t_c g}{L}\frac{\partial G_w}{\partial\bar z} =
        -(\alpha -1)\beta^{-1}\delta
        (\bar\lambda_n'(S)f_w(S) + \bar\lambda_n(S)f_w'(S))
        \frac{\partial S}{\partial\bar z}
        

Introducing another dimensionless variable,

.. math::
         \epsilon = t_cQ = \frac{L^2Q}{\lambda_cP_c},

we can write :ref:`(299) <Eq:scale:twoph:Peq:s0>`-:ref:`(301) <Eq:scale:twoph:Seq:s0>` in the
final dimensionless form as

.. _Eq:scale:twoph:Peq:s:

    \tag{303}
    \bar{\boldsymbol{v}} = -\bar\lambda_t\bar\nabla\bar P +

        \delta(\bar\lambda_w + \alpha\beta^{-1}\bar\lambda_n)\boldsymbol{k},

        \phi\frac{\partial S}{\partial\bar t} + f_w'(S)\bar{\boldsymbol{v}}\cdot
        \bar\nabla S = -
        \bar\nabla\cdot(-\beta^{-1}\bar\lambda_n(S)f_w(S)\bar p_c'(S)\bar\nabla S) -
        \nonumber

        \epsilon{\thinspace .}
        
        

The eight input parameters :math:`L`, :math:`q_w`, :math:`q_n`, :math:`\mu_w`, :math:`\mu_n`,
:math:`\varrho_w`, :math:`\varrho_n`, and :math:`K` are reduced to five dimensionless
parameters :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta`, :math:`\gamma`, :math:`\delta`, and :math:`\epsilon`.
There are six remaining dimensionless numbers to be set: :math:`K_{wm}`,
:math:`K_{nm}`, :math:`S_{wr}`, :math:`S_{nr}`, :math:`a`, and :math:`b`.

The bidomain model in electrophysiology
=======================================

The mechanical functioning of the heart is crucially dependent on
correct electric signal propagation through the heart tissue.
Understanding this signal propagation via mathematical modeling has
therefore been a topic of increasing interest in the medical research
on heart failure, stroke, and other heart-related diseases
[Ref11]_.  Below we list a common mathematical model,
consisting of two PDEs coupled to a system of ODEs at each spatial
point in the domain, and show how this model can be brought to a
dimensionless form.

The mathematical model          (2)
-----------------------------------

.. index:: bidomain equations

A widely used mathematical model for the electric signal propagation
in the heart tissue is the bidomain equations:

.. _Eq:scale:bidomain:eqv:

.. math::

    \tag{305}
    \chi C_m\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} =
        \nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot (\sigma_i\nabla u_e) - \chi I_{\rm{ion}}
        - \chi I_{\rm{app}},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:bidomain:equ_e:

.. math::

    \tag{306}
    0 = \nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot ((\sigma_i + \sigma_e)\nabla u_e){\thinspace .}
        
        

These PDEs are posed in a spatial domain :math:`H` for :math:`t\in (0, T]`, and the symbols have the following meaning:
:math:`u_e` is the extracellular electric potential,
:math:`v` is the transmembrane potential (difference between the extracellular
and intracellular potential),
:math:`C_m` is the capacitance of the cell membrane,
:math:`\chi` is a membrane area to cell volume ratio,
:math:`\sigma_i` is an electric conductivity tensor for the intracellular space, and
:math:`\sigma_e` is an electric conductivity tensor for the extracellular space.

The boundary conditions are of Neumann type, but we drop these from
the discussion, just to make things a bit simpler.  The initial
condition is typically :math:`u_e=0, v = v_r`, where :math:`v_{r}` is a constant
resting potential.

The PDE system is driven by :math:`I_{\rm{ion}} + I_{\rm{app}}`, where
:math:`I_{\rm{ion}}` is a reaction term describing ionic currents across the
cell membrane, and $ I_{\rm{app}}$ is an externally applied stimulus
current. The applied current is a prescribed function,
typically piecewise constant in time and space, while
:math:`I_{\rm{ion}} = I_{\rm{ion}}(v,s)`, where :math:`s` is a state vector
describing the electro-chemical state of the cells. Typical components
of :math:`s` are intracellular ionic concentrations and so-called gate variables that
describe the permeability of the cell membrane. The dynamics of :math:`s` is
governed by a system of ODEs, see for instance [Ref11]_ for
details. The total
current :math:`I_{\rm{ion}}` is often written as a sum of individual
ionic currents:

.. _Eq:scale:bidomain:ion1:

.. math::

    \tag{307}
    I_{\rm{ion}}(s,v) = \sum_{j=1}^n I_{j}(s,v),
        
        

where :math:`n` is typically between 10 and 20 in recent models of cardiac
cells. Most of the individual currents will be on the form
$ I_{j}(s,v) = g_j(s)(v-v_j), $
where :math:`v_j` is the equilibrium potential of the specific ion, and
:math:`g_j(s)` describes the membrane conductance of the particular ion channel. Without
much loss of generality we can assume that this formulation is valid
for all :math:`I_{j}`, and the total ionic current can then be written in the
general form

.. math::
        
        I_{\rm{ion}}(s,v) = \sum_{j=1}^n I_{j}(s,v) = g(s)(v-v_{eq}(s)) ,
        

where :math:`g(s) = \sum_{j=1}^n g_j(s)` and :math:`v_{eq}(s) = (\sum_{j=1}^n g_j
v_j)/(\sum_{j=1}^n g_j)`.

As noted above, the dynamics of :math:`s` is governed by an ODE system on
the form

.. math::
        
        \frac{ds}{dt} = f(v,s) {\thinspace .}
        

and the individual components of :math:`s` typically have very
different time scales, making any scaling of this system highly dependent on the
component under study. For the present text, the focus is on
tissue-level electrophysiology as described by
:ref:`(305) <Eq:scale:bidomain:eqv>`-:ref:`(306) <Eq:scale:bidomain:equ_e>`, and we will proceed
to scale these equations. The equations are of
reaction-diffusion type, and the scaling will be based on the general
non-linear reaction-diffusion equation in the section :ref:`sec:scale:diffu:homo1D`.

Scaling          (10)
---------------------

Dimensionless independent variables are introduced by

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad
        \bar y = \frac{y}{L},\quad \bar z = \frac{z}{L},\quad
        \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},

where :math:`L` is the characteristic length scale, and :math:`t_c` is the
characteristic time scale. Dimensionless dependent variables are
expressed as

.. math::
         \bar v = \frac{v-v_r}{v_p-v_r},\quad \bar u = \frac{u_e}{u_c} {\thinspace .}

As noted above, :math:`v_r` is the resting potential, and :math:`v_p` is the peak
transmembrane potential.
The scaling of :math:`v` ensures :math:`\bar v\in [0,1]`. We introduce the symbol
:math:`\Delta v = v_p-v_r` to save space in the formulas: :math:`\bar v = (v-v_r)/\Delta v`.
The scale for :math:`u_e` is :math:`u_c`, to be
determined either from simplicity of the equations or from available analysis of
its magnitude.

The variable tensor coefficients :math:`\sigma_i` and :math:`\sigma_e` depend on the spatial
coordinates and are also scaled:

.. math::
         \bar \sigma_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_c},\quad \bar \sigma_e = \frac{\sigma_e}{\sigma_c}{\thinspace .}

For simplicity, we have chosen a common scale :math:`\sigma_c`, but the two tensors
may employ different scales, and we may also choose different scales
for different directions, to reflect the anisotropic conductivity of
the tissue. A typical choice of :math:`\sigma_c` is a norm of
:math:`\sigma_i + \sigma_e`, e.g., the maximum value.

Finally, we introduce a scaling of the parameters entering the ionic
current term

.. math::
         \bar v_{eq} = (v_{eq}-v_r)/\Delta v,\quad\bar g = g/g_c{\thinspace .}

For the characteristic membrane conductance, :math:`g_c`,  a common choice is
:math:`g_c = 1/R_m`, where :math:`R_m` is the membrane resistance at
rest, but we will instead set :math:`g_c = g_{\max}`, the maximum conductance
of the membrane. These choices will ensure :math:`\bar v_{eq}, \bar g \in
[0,1]`.

Inserting the dimensionless variables in
:ref:`(305) <Eq:scale:bidomain:eqv>`-:ref:`(306) <Eq:scale:bidomain:equ_e>`, the system
of governing equations becomes

.. math::
        
        \frac{\Delta v}{t_c}\chi C_m\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
        \frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
        \frac{\sigma_c u_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\ 
        &\quad - \chi g_c \Delta v \bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s)) -\chi I_{\rm{app}},
        \\ 
        0 &= \frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) + \frac{\sigma_cu_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\ 
        

Multiplying the equations by appropriate factors leads to equations with
dimensionless terms only:

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
        \frac{t_c\sigma_c}{\chi C_mL^2}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
        \frac{t_c\sigma_c u_c}{\Delta v \chi C_mL^2}\nabla\cdot (\bar
        \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) - \\ 
        &\quad
        \frac{g_c t_c}{C_m} \bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s))
        - \frac{t_c}{C_m\Delta v} I_{\rm{app}},\\ 
        0 &= \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) + \frac{u_c}{\Delta v}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\ 
        

The time scale is not so obvious to choose. As noted above, the ODE
system that governs :math:`s` and thereby :math:`\bar g(s), \bar v_{eq} (s)` may
feature a wide range of temporal scales. Furthermore, even if we focus
on the tissue equations and on the dynamics of :math:`v` and :math:`u_e`, the
choice of natural time and length scales is not trivial.
The equations are of reaction-diffusion nature, and the
solution takes the form of a narrow wavefront of activation that
propagates through the tissue. The region immediately surrounding
the wavefront is characterized by large spatial and temporal
gradients, while in most of the
domain the variations are quite slow. The primary interest is
usually on the wavefront phenomenon, so
for now, we choose the time scale
based on balancing the reaction and diffusion components, as described
in the section :ref:`sec:scale:diffu:homo1D`.  We consequently
set the terms in front of the reaction term and the diffusion term to
unity, which means

.. math::
         \frac{t_c\sigma_c}{\chi C_mL^2} = 1,\quad \frac{t_cg_c}{C_m} =1,

and this principle determines the time and length scales as

.. math::
         t_c = \frac{C_m}{g_c},\quad L = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c}{g_c \chi}}{\thinspace .}

Two natural dimensionless variables then arise from the second diffusion
term and the applied current term:

.. math::
         \beta = \frac{u_c}{\Delta v}, \quad \gamma =
        \frac{I_{\rm{app}}}{g_c \Delta v} {\thinspace .}

In many cases it will be natural to set :math:`u_c=\Delta v`, which of
course removes the need for :math:`\beta`, but we
include the freedom to have :math:`u_c` as
some specified characteristic size of :math:`u_e` (i.e., :math:`u_c` is not a
"free parameter", but is expressed by the other parameters in the
problem).

The final dimensionless system becomes

.. _Eq:_auto95:

.. math::

    \tag{308}
    \frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} =
        \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
        \beta\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) 
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto96:

.. math::

    \tag{309}
    \quad -\bar g (s)(\bar v-\bar v_{eq}(s))
        - \gamma
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto97:

    \tag{310}
    0 = \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar v) +
        \beta\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u) {\thinspace .}
        
        

The two dimensionless variables in these equations have
straightforward
interpretations: :math:`\beta` is the ratio of the span in the two electric
potentials, and :math:`\gamma` is ratio of the source term :math:`I_{\rm{app}}` and the
time-derivative term of :math:`v`, or the source term and the diffusion term
in :math:`v`.

We can insert typical parameter values to get a feel for the
chosen scaling. We have

.. math::
        
        C_m &= 1.0\, \mu\hbox{F cm}^{-2}, \quad g_c = g_{max} = 13.0
        \hbox{m S}\mu\hbox{F}^{-1} = 13.0 \hbox{mS cm}^{-2}, \\ 
        \chi &= 2000 \hbox{cm}^{-1} , \quad u_c = \Delta v = 100 \hbox{mV} ,
        \sigma_c = 3.0 \hbox{mS cm}^{-1}{\thinspace .}
        

This gives the following values of :math:`t_c` and :math:`L`:

.. math::
        
        t_c &= \frac{1.0 \mu\hbox{ F cm}^{-2}}{13.0 \mu\hbox{ F cm}^{-2}} =
        \frac{1.0}{13.0}\frac{\mu\hbox{ F}}{\hbox{mS}} \approx 0.076 \hbox{ ms}, \\ 
        L &= \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c}{\chi g_c}} = \sqrt{\frac{3.0
        \hbox{ mS cm}^{-2}}{2000\hbox{ cm}^{-1} \mu\hbox{ F cm}^-2}}
        \approx 0.087 \hbox{ mm} {\thinspace .}
        

These values are both very small, which is related to our
choice of :math:`g_c = g_{\max}`. This choice implies that we base the
scaling on the upstroke phase of the action potential, when both
spatial and temporal variations are extremely high. This may therefore
be a "correct" scaling exactly at the wavefront of the electrical
potential, but is less relevant elsewhere. Choosing :math:`g_c` to be for
instance the resting conductance, which is the common choice when
scaling the cable equation, may increase :math:`t_c, L` by factors up to 2500 and
50, respectively. The large difference in scales reflects the
difference between active, dynamic signal conduction and passive
signals governed solely by electrodiffusion.

The conduction velocity is often a quantity of interest, and we could
obtain an alternative relation between :math:`t_c` and :math:`L` by setting
:math:`CV = L/t_c`, where :math:`CV` is the conduction velocity.
In human cardiac tissue :math:`CV` is known to be about
60 cm/s, while the choices above give

.. math::
        
        \frac{L}{t_c} =  \frac{0.087\rm{mm}}{0.076\rm{ms}} \approx 144 {\thinspace .}
        \hbox{cm/s}{\thinspace .} 

Enforcing :math:`L/t_c = 60 \hbox{cm s}^{-1}` gives the constraint :math:`g_c \approx
4.8 \hbox{mS cm}^{-2}`, and yields :math:`L \approx 0.17` mm and
:math:`t_c=0.21` ms.

.. These are still small values, but very close to the

.. standard values of :math:`\Delta x, \Delta t` required for accurate

.. numerical solution. That is, this choice of scaling will give :math:`\Delta x

.. \approx \Delta t \approx 1`, instead of :math:`\bar t, \bar x \approx 1`?

An alternative :math:`I_{\rm{ion}}`
-----------------------------------
The simplest model that gives a qualitatively realistic description of
the cardiac action potential is the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model. In
contrast to the model :ref:`(307) <Eq:scale:bidomain:ion1>` discussed above, the
FHN model is completely phenomenological, with no relation to the
underlying biophysics. However, the model can be parameterized to give
reasonable values for the voltages, and has the advantage of giving a
self-contained and relatively simple model that does not depend on
externally determined variables like the :math:`s` vector above. As above,
we have the bidomain model given by

.. _Eq:scale:bidomain:eqv2:

.. math::

    \tag{311}
    \chi C_m\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} =
        \nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot (\sigma_i\nabla u_e) - \chi I_{\rm{ion}}
        - \chi I_{\rm{app}},
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:bidomain:equ2:

.. math::

    \tag{312}
    0 = \nabla\cdot( \sigma_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot ((\sigma_i + \sigma_e)\nabla u_e),
        
        

but now with

.. math::
         I_{\rm{ion}} = -A[(v-v_r)(v-v_{th})(v-v_p) - w(v-v_r)(v_p-v_r)^2], 

where :math:`w` is governed by an ODE on the form

.. math::
         \frac{dw}{dt} = k(v-v_r)-l w {\thinspace .}

Choosing :math:`A=4.16\cdot 10^{-4} \hbox{mS}/(\hbox{mV}^2),  v_r=-85\hbox{mV},
v_{th}= -68\hbox{mV}, v_p=40\hbox{mV}, k = 4.0\cdot10^{-5} \hbox{mV}^{-1}\hbox{ms}^{-1}, l
=0.013\hbox{ms}^{-1},` gives reasonably physiological values for :math:`v`,
while :math:`w` is a dimensionless variable with values in :math:`[0,1]`.
The somewhat strange choice of parameter units are
required because the function is cubic in :math:`v`.
Typical initial conditions are :math:`v=v_r, u_e = w=0`,
and :math:`I_{app}` is piecewise constant in space and time, with a typical
value being :math:`I_{app} = -50\, \hbox{mA}` applied for 2 ms in certain regions of
the domain.

The equations can be scaled following the same procedure as above. In
addition to the dimensionless variables introduced above, we introduce

.. math::
        
        \alpha = \frac{v_{th}-v_r}{\Delta v} ,
        

and in terms of the dimensionless variables, we get

.. math::
        
        \frac{\Delta v}{t_c}\chi C_m\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
        \frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
        \frac{\sigma_c u_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\ 
        &\quad - \chi A\Delta v^3 (\bar v (\bar  v-\alpha)(\bar v -1) -
        \bar v w) -\chi I_{\rm{app}},
        \\ 
        0 &= \frac{\sigma_c\Delta v }{L^2}\bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar
        \nabla \bar v)
        + \frac{\sigma_cu_c}{L^2}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\ 
        \frac{1}{t_c} \frac{dw}{dt} &= k \Delta v \bar v
        -l w {\thinspace .}
        

As above, we multiply with suitable factors to arrive at

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
        \frac{\sigma_c t_c}{L^2 C_m \chi}\nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
        \frac{\sigma_c t_c u_c}{\Delta v L^2 C_m \chi}\nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\ 
        &\quad - \frac{t_c A\Delta v^2}{C_m} (\bar v (\bar v-\alpha)(\bar v -1) - \bar v
        w) -\chi I_{\rm{app}}, \\ 
        0 &= \frac{\sigma_c}{L^2}\bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar
        \nabla \bar v)
        + \frac{\sigma_cu_c}{\Delta v L^2}\nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\ 
        \frac{dw}{dt}&= k {t_c}{\Delta v} \bar
        v -t_c l w {\thinspace .}
        

The time and length scales are again chosen by requiring balance of
the reaction and diffusion term, which gives

.. math::
        
        t_c = \frac{C_m}{A \Delta v^2},\quad L = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c}{A
        \Delta v^2 \chi}},
        

and we arrive at the final dimensionless system

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
        \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
        \alpha \nabla\cdot (\bar \sigma_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\ 
        &\quad - (\bar v (\bar v-\alpha)(\bar v -1) - \bar v
        w) -\beta, \\ 
        0 &= \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar \sigma_i\bar
        \nabla \bar v)
        + \alpha \nabla\cdot ((\bar \sigma_i + \bar \sigma_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\ 
        \frac{dw}{dt}&= \bar k \bar
        v -\bar l w ,
        

where we have introduced the dimensionless numbers

.. math::
        
        \bar k = k {t_c}{\Delta v} , \quad \bar l = t_c l {\thinspace .}

Exercise 4.1: Comparison of vibration models for elastic structures
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The time scale for displacement in elastic structures is, according to
the section :ref:`scale:elasticity:timedep`, :math:`t_c=L\sqrt{\varrho/\mu}` if we
assume constant density :math:`\varrho` and constant shear modulus :math:`\mu` for
the structure. The purpose of this exercise is to compare this time
scale with the time scales of related models.

         \varrho\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + E\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0,

where :math:`u(x,t)` is the displacement along the bar, and :math:`E` is Young's modulus,
related to the shear modulus :math:`\mu` through

.. math::
         E = 2\mu (1+\nu),

Exercise 4.2: A model for quasi-static poro-elasticity
------------------------------------------------------

Flow through a porous elastic medium may induce stress and deformation.
This process is known as poro-elasticity and is governed by the
following equations for a homogeneous medium:

.. _Eq:_auto98:

.. math::

    \tag{313}
    (\lambda + \mu)\nabla (\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}) + \mu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} = -\alpha\nabla p -
        \varrho\boldsymbol{f},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto99:

.. math::

    \tag{314}
    S\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = \frac{K}{\mu_f}\nabla^2 p +
        \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u},
        
        

where :math:`\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)` is the displacement field, :math:`\lambda` and :math:`\mu` are
Lame's elasticity parameters, :math:`\alpha\in [0,1]`, :math:`\boldsymbol{f}` is the body
force, here assumed constant (usually gravity, :math:`\boldsymbol{f} = -g\boldsymbol{k}`,
:math:`S` is a so-called storage coefficient, :math:`p(\boldsymbol{x},t)` is the fluid pressure,
:math:`K` is the medium's permeability, :math:`\mu_f` is the dynamic viscosity of
the fluid, and :math:`\varrho` is the density of the fluid-solid mixture:

.. math::
         \varrho = (1-\phi) \varrho_s + \phi\varrho_f, 

with :math:`\varrho_f` being the density of the fluid, :math:`\varrho_s` the density
of the solid, and :math:`\phi` the porosity of the elastic medium.
The equations are known as Biot's equations of poro-elasticity and written
here in a quasi-static form where elastic waves are neglected.

Scale this partial differential equation model, assuming that
:math:`\lambda`, :math:`\mu`, :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\boldsymbol{f}`, :math:`\varrho`, :math:`\phi`, :math:`\varrho_s`,
:math:`\varrho_f`, :math:`S`, :math:`\mu_f`, and :math:`K` are all constants.

Problem 4.3: Starting Couette flow
----------------------------------

A fluid is confined in a channel with two planar walls :math:`z=0` and :math:`z=H`.
The fluid is at rest. At time :math:`t=0` the upper wall is suddenly set in
motion with a velocity :math:`U\boldsymbol{i}`. We assume that the velocity is
directed along the :math:`x` axis: :math:`\boldsymbol{u} = u(x,z,t)\boldsymbol{i}`. From the equation of continuity, :math:`\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} =0`, we get that :math:`\partial u/\partial x = 0` such
that :math:`\boldsymbol{u} = u(z,t)\boldsymbol{i}`. The boundary conditions are :math:`\boldsymbol{u}=0` at the lower
wall :math:`z=0` and :math:`\boldsymbol{u} = U\boldsymbol{i}` at the upper wall :math:`z=H`. Assume that the
pressure is constant everywhere and that there are no body forces.

**a)**
Start with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the
assumption :math:`\boldsymbol{u} = u(z,t)\boldsymbol{i}`. Derive an initial-boundary value problem

Why is this an inferior approach to scaling the problem?

.. _scale:vib:exer:channel:

Problem 4.4: Channel flow
-------------------------

We look at viscous fluid flow between two flat, infinite plates.
Often, one first reduces such a problem to mathematical
one-dimensional problems and then scale the model (cf. :ref:`scale:vib:exer:starting_Couette`), but if a general 2D/3D
numerical Navier-Stokes model is to be used to solve the problem, it
is more natural to just scale the full Navier-Stokes equations and then
run the solver for the scaled model.

This is a problem dominated by viscous diffusion and shear stresses
and where there is no convection. Argue why the standard scaling of
the Navier-Stokes equations is inappropriate. Scale the equations and
choose the time scale and pressure scale such that :math:`\partial\bar
u/\partial\bar t`, :math:`\bar\nabla^2\bar u`, and :math:`\bar\nabla\bar p` all
have unit coefficients. This naturally gives a time scale based on
viscous diffusion and a pressure scale based on the shear stress :math:`\mu
U/H`, where :math:`H` is the width of the channel, and :math:`U` a characteristic
inlet velocity. Set up the scaled problem and derive an exact solution
in the stationary case.

.. Closing remarks for this Problem

Remarks          (5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One may want to implement the Navier-Stokes equations in scaled form
to have only one parameter Re in the PDEs. However, whatever we want
to compute with the solver, we need to benchmark it on 2D/3D channel
flow to verify that it works, and the proper scaling is different
in this simple application. Therefore, the software should implement
the original form of the Navier-Stokes equations, as this is the
most general form of the model. In a particular application, one can
derive a scaled model and set parameters in the original PDEs to mimic
the scaled model. The present case of channel flow faces a problem, however,
as there is no unique coefficient in front of the convective term in
the original Navier-Stokes equations. We may therefore insert such
a parameter in the implementation,

.. math::
         \rho \boldsymbol{u}_t + \alpha\rho \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} = -nabla p + \nu\nabla^2\boldsymbol{u} + \boldsymbol{f},

but the convective term will vanish
for channel flow so there is little effect of Re in front of this term.
Our scaling is obtained by setting :math:`\rho=\nu=1` and :math:`\alpha=\mathrm{Re}`.
