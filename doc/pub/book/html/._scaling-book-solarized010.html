<h1 id="sec:scale:ns">The Navier-Stokes equations</h1>

<h2 id="___sec104">The momentum equation without body forces </h2>

<p>
The Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous fluid flow
take the form

$$
\begin{align}
\varrho\left(\frac{\partial \u}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla\u\right)
&= -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\u,
\tag{128}\\ 
\nabla\cdot\u & = 0\tp
\tag{129}
\end{align}
$$

The primary unknowns are the
\( \u \) is the velocity of the fluid and \( p \) is the pressure, while
\( \varrho \) is the fluid density, and \( \mu \) is the dynamic viscosity.

<p>
We introduce as usual dimensionless independent and dependent variables:

$$ \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad \bar y = \frac{y}{L},\quad
\bar z= \frac{z}{L},\quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},\quad
\bar\u = \frac{\u}{u_c},\quad \bar p = \frac{p}{p_c},$$

where \( L \) is some characteristic distance,
\( t_c \) is some characteristic time, \( u_c \) is a characteristic
velocity, and \( p_c \) is characteristic pressure.
Inserted in the equations,

$$
\begin{align}
\varrho\left(\frac{u_c}{t_c}\frac{\partial \bar\u}{\partial \bar t} + \frac{u_c^2}{L}\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\u\right)
&= -\frac{p_c}{L}\bar\nabla\bar p + \frac{u_c}{L^2}\mu\bar \nabla^2\bar\u,
\tag{130}\\ 
\frac{u_c}{L}\bar\nabla\cdot\bar\u & = 0\tp
\tag{131}
\end{align}
$$

For the velocity it is common to just introduce some \( U \) for
\( u_c \). This \( U \) is normally implied by the problem description.

<!-- begin inline comment -->
<font color="red">(<b>hpl 13</b>: Show examples of confined and unconfined flow and what \( U \) is.)</font>
<!-- end inline comment -->

For example, \( U \) is often chosen as a characteristic inlet velocity
in the flow problem.
Having a characteristic distance \( L \) and velocity \( U \), an obvious
time measure is \( L/U \) so we set \( t_c=L/U \). Dividing by the
coefficient in front of the time derivative term, creates a pressure
term

$$ \frac{p_c}{\varrho U^2}\bar\nabla\bar p\tp$$

The coefficient suggest a choice \( p_c=\varrho U^2 \) if the pressure
gradient term is to have the same size as the acceleration terms.

<h2 id="___sec105">The most common dimensionless form of the Navier-Stokes equations </h2>

<p>
The discussions so far results in the following dimensionless form of
<a href="#mjx-eqn-128">(128)</a> and <a href="#mjx-eqn-129">(129)</a>:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \bar\u}{\partial \bar t} +
\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\u
&= -\bar\nabla p + \hbox{Re}^{-1}\nabla^2\u,
\tag{132}\\ 
\bar\nabla\cdot \bar\u &= 0,
\end{align}
$$

where Re is the famous <em>Reynolds number</em>,

$$ \hbox{Re}= \frac{\varrho UL}{\mu} = \frac{UL}{\nu}\tp$$

The latter expression makes use of the kinematic viscosity \( \nu = \mu/\varrho \).
For viscous fluid flows without body forces there is hence only one
dimensionless number, Re.

<p>
The Reynolds number can be interpreted as the ratio of convection and
viscosity:

$$ \hbox{Re} = \frac{\hbox{convection}}{\hbox{viscosity}} =
\frac{\varrho U^2/L}{\mu U/L^2} = \frac{UL}{\nu}\tp$$

(We have here used that \( \nabla\u \) goes like \( U/L \) and \( \nabla^2\u \)
goes like \( U/L^2 \).)

<h2 id="___sec106">Scaling of time for low Reynolds numbers </h2>

<p>
As we discussed in the section <a href="._scaling-book-solarized009.html#scale:convdiff">Convection-diffusion with a force term</a> for the convection-diffusion
equation, there is not just one scaling that fits all problems.
Above, we used \( t_c=L/U \), which is appropriate if convection is
a dominating physical effect. In case the convection term
\( \varrho\u\cdot\nabla\u \)
is much smaller
than the viscosity term \( \mu\nabla^2\u \), i.e., the Reynolds number
is small, the viscosity term is dominating. However,
if the scaling is suitable, the other terms are of order unity, and
\( \hbox{Re}^{-1}\nabla^2\bar\u \) must then also be of unit size,
implying that \( \nabla^2\bar\u \) is very small, but then the scaling is
not suitable. In the low-Reynolds number regime, the diffusion effect
of \( \nabla^2\bar\u \) is dominating, and we should use a time scale
based on diffusion rather than convection. Such a time scale is
\( t_c = L^2/(\mu/\varrho) = L^2/\nu \).
With this time scale, the Navier-Stokes equation looks like

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \bar\u}{\partial \bar t} +
\hbox{Re}\,\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\u
&= -\bar\nabla p + \nabla^2\u,
\tag{133}\\ 
\bar\nabla\cdot\bar\u &= 0\tp
\end{align}
$$

As stated in the box in the section <a href="._scaling-book-solarized009.html#scale:convdiff">Convection-diffusion with a force term</a>, <a href="#mjx-eqn-133">(133)</a> is the appropriate PDE for very low Reynolds number flow and
suggest neglecting the convection term.
If the flow is also steady, the time derivative term can be neglected,
and we end up with the so-called <em>Stokes problem</em> for steady, slow, viscous
flow:

$$
\begin{align}
-\bar\nabla p + \nabla^2\u &= 0,
\tag{134}\\ 
\bar\nabla\cdot\bar\u &= 0\tp
\end{align}
$$

This flow regime is also known as <em>Stokes' flow</em> or <em>creeping flow</em>.

<h2 id="___sec107">Shear stress as pressure scale </h2>

<p>
Instead of using the kinetic energy \( \varrho U^2 \) as pressure scale,
one can use the shear stress \( \mu U/L \) (\( U/L \) reflects the spatial
derivative of the velocity, as in the shear stress expression
\( \mu\partial u/\partial y \)). Using \( U \) as velocity scale, \( L/U \) as
time scale, and \( \mu U/L \) as pressure scale, results in

$$
\begin{equation}
\hbox{Re}\left(\frac{\partial \bar\u}{\partial \bar t} +
\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\u\right)
= -\bar\nabla\bar p + \nabla^2\bar\u\tp
\end{equation}
$$

<h2 id="___sec108">Including the gravity force </h2>

<p>
We now add a gravity force to the momentum equation
<a href="#mjx-eqn-128">(128)</a>:

$$
\begin{equation}
\varrho\left(\frac{\partial \u}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla\u\right)
= -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\u - \varrho g\kk,
\tag{135}
\end{equation}
$$

where \( g \) is the acceleration of gravity, and \( \kk \) is a unit
vector in the opposite direction of gravity. The new term
takes the following form after non-dimensionalization:

$$ \frac{t_c}{\varrho  u_c}\varrho g \kk =  \frac{Lg}{U^2}\kk
= \hbox{Fr}^{-2}\kk,$$

where Fr is the Froude number,

$$ \hbox{Fr} = \frac{U}{\sqrt{Lg}}\tp$$

<h2 id="___sec109">Oscillating boundary conditions </h2>

<p>
Many flows has an oscillating nature, often arising from some
oscillating boundary conditions. Suppose such a condition at some
boundary \( x=\hbox{const} \) takes the specific form

$$ \u = U\sin(\omega t)\ii\tp$$

The dimensionless form becomes

$$ U\bar\u = U\sin(\omega \frac{L}{U}\bar t)\ii,$$

if \( t_c=L/U \) is the appropriate time scale. This condition can be
written

$$
\begin{equation}
\bar\u = \sin(\hbox{St}\,\bar t),
\end{equation}
$$

where St is the <em>Strouhal number</em>,

$$
\begin{equation}
\hbox{St} = \frac{\omega L}{U}\tp
\end{equation}
$$

The two important dimensionless parameters in oscillating flows are
then the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers.

<p>
Even if the boundary conditions
are of steady type, as for flow around a sphere or cylinder,
the flow may at certain Reynolds numbers get unsteady and oscillating.
For \( 10^2 < \hbox{Re} < 10^7 \), steady inflow towards a cylinder will
cause vortex shedding: an array of vortices are periodically shedded
from the cylinder, producing an oscillating flow pattern and force
on the cylinder. The Strouhal number is used to characterize the
frequency of oscillations. The phenomenon, known as <em>von Karman
vortex street</em>, is particularly important if the frequency
of the force on the cylinder hits the free vibration frequency
of the cylinder such that resonance occurs. The result can be large
displacements of the cylinder and structural failure. A famous
case in engineering is the failure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)" target="_self">Tacoma Narrows suspension
bridge</a>
in 1940, when wind-induced vortex shedding caused resonance
with the free torsional vibrations of the bridge.

<h2 id="___sec110">The Euler number </h2>

<p>
The dimensionless pressure in <a href="#mjx-eqn-132">(132)</a>
made use of the pressure scale \( p_c=\varrho U^2 \). This is an
appropriate scale if the pressure level is not of importance, which
is very often the case since only the pressure <em>gradient</em> enters
the flow equation and drives the flow. However, there are circumstances
where the pressure level is of importance. For example, in some flows
the pressure may become so low that the vapor pressure of the liquid
is reached and that vapor cavities form (a phenomenon known as
<em>cavitation</em>). A more appropriate pressure scale is then
\( p_c = p_{\infty} - p_v \), where \( p_\infty \) is a characteristic
pressure level far from vapor cavities and \( p_v \) is the vapor pressure.
The coefficient in front of the dimensionless pressure gradient is then

$$ \frac{p_{\infty} - p_v}{\varrho U^2}\tp $$

Inspired by Bernoulli's equation \( p + \frac{1}{2}\varrho U^2 = \hbox{const} \)
in fluid mechanics, a factor \( \frac{1}{2} \) is often inserted in the
denominator, and the corresponding dimensionless number,

$$
\begin{equation}
\hbox{Eu} = \frac{p_{\infty} - p_v}{\frac{1}{2}\varrho U^2},
\end{equation}
$$

is called the <em>Euler number</em>. The pressure gradient term now reads
\( \frac{1}{2}\hbox{Eu}\,\bar\nabla\bar p \). The Euler number
expresses the ratio of pressure differences and the kinetic
energy of the flow.

<h2 id="___sec111">Free surface conditions </h2>

<p>
At a free surface, \( z=\eta(x,y,t) \), the boundary conditions are

$$
\begin{align}
w &= \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla\eta,\\ 
p - p_0 &=  - \sigma\left(R_x^{-1} + R_y^{-1}\right)\approx
-\sigma\left(\frac{\partial^2\eta}{\partial x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2\eta}{\partial y^2}\right),
\tag{136}
\end{align}
$$

where \( w \) is the velocity component in the \( z \) direction,
\( p_0 \) is the atmospheric air pressure at the surface,
\( \sigma \) represents the surface tension,
while \( R_x \) and \( R_y \) are radii of curvature of the surface \( z=\eta \),
which for small surface deformations can be approximated by second-order
derivatives of \( \eta \) as indicated.

<p>
The dimensionless form of these conditions starts with

$$
\begin{align*}
u_c\bar w &= \frac{L}{t_c}
\frac{\partial\bar\eta}{\partial\bar t} +
u_c\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\eta,\\ 
p_c \bar p &\approx
-\frac{1}{L}\sigma\left(\frac{\partial^2\bar\eta}{\partial \bar x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2\bar\eta}{\partial \bar y^2}\right)\tp
\end{align*}
$$

The characteristic length \( L \) is usually taken as the depth of the fluid
when the surface is flat. We have used
\( \bar p = (p - p_0)/p_c \) for making the pressure dimensionless.
Using \( u_c=U \), \( t_c=L/U \), and \( p_c = \varrho U^2 \), results in

$$
\begin{align}
\bar w &= \frac{\partial\bar\eta}{\partial\bar t} +
\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\eta,\\ 
\bar p &\approx
- \hbox{We}^{-1}\left(\frac{\partial^2\bar\eta}{\partial \bar x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2\bar\eta}{\partial \bar y^2}\right),
\tag{137}
\end{align}
$$

where We is the <em>Weber number</em>,

$$
\begin{equation}
\hbox{We} = \frac{\varrho U^2L}{\sigma}\tp
\label{}
\end{equation}
$$

The weber number measures the importance of surface tension effects and
is the ratio of the pressure scale \( \varrho U^2 \) and the surface
tension force per area, typically \( \sigma/R_x \) in a 2D problem, which
has size \( \sigma/L \).

<h1 id="___sec112">Thermal convection </h1>

<p>
Temperature differences in fluid flow cause density differences, and since
cold fluid is heavier than hot fluid, the gravity force will induce
flow due to density differences. This effect is called free thermal
convection. Forced convection refers to the case where there is no
feedback from the temperature field to the motion, i.e., temperature
differences do not create motion, and the temperature distribution
is only dependent on a given velocity field.

<h2 id="___sec113">Forced convection </h2>

<p>
The model governing forced convection consists of the Navier-Stokes
equation and the energy equation for the temperature:

$$
\begin{align}
\varrho\left(\frac{\partial \u}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla\u\right)
&= -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\u - \varrho g\kk,
\tag{138}\\ 
\nabla\cdot\u & = 0,
\tag{139}\\ 
\varrho c\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla T\right)
&= \kappa\nabla^2 T\tp
\tag{140}\\ 
\end{align}
$$

The symbol \( T \) is the temperature, \( c \) is a heat capacity, and \( \kappa \)
is the heat conduction coefficient for the fluid.

<p>
Despite the fact that \( \varrho \) depends on \( T \), we treat \( \varrho \)
as a constant. The major effect of this dependence is through the
buoyancy effect caused by the gravity term \( -g\kk \). We drop this
term, and assume the momentum and continuity equations to be
independent of the temperature. The flow is driven by boundary
conditions, from which we can find a characteristic velocity \( U \).

<p>
We introduce dimensionless parameters according to

$$ \bar x = \frac{x}{L},
\ t_c = \frac{L}{U},\ 
\bar\u = \frac{\u}{U},\ \bar p = \frac{p}{\varrho U^2},\ 
\bar T = \frac{T-T_0}{T_c}\tp$$

Other coordinates are also scaled by \( L \).
The characteristic temperature \( T_c \) is chosen as some range \( \Delta T \),
which depends on the problem and is often given by the
thermal initial and/or
boundary conditions. The reference temperature \( T_0 \) is also
implied by prescribed conditions.
Inserted in the equations, we get

$$
\begin{align*}
\varrho\frac{U^2}{L}\frac{\partial \bar\u}{\partial \bar t} +
\varrho\frac{U^2}{L}\bar \u\cdot\bar \nabla\bar\u
&= -{1}{L}\bar\nabla \bar p + \frac{\mu U}{L^2}
\bar \nabla^2\bar \u,
\\ 
\frac{U}{L}\bar\nabla\cdot\bar\u & = 0,
\\ 
\varrho_0 c\left(\frac{T_c U}{L}
\frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar t} +
\frac{UT_c}{L}\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla \bar T\right)
&= \frac{\kappa T_c}{L^2}
\bar \nabla^2 \bar T \tp
\end{align*}
$$

Making each term in each equation dimensionless reduces the system to

$$
\begin{align}

The two dimensionless numbers in this system are given by

The Peclet number is here defined as the ratio of the
convection term for heat \( \varrho_0 c U\Delta T/L \) and the
heat conduction term \( \kappa U/L^2 \). The fraction
\( \kappa/(\varrho_0 c) \) is known as the thermal diffusivity,
and if this quantity is given a symbol \( \dfc \), we realize the
relation to the Peclet number defined in the section <a href="._scaling-book-solarized009.html#scale:convdiff">Convection-diffusion with a force term</a>.

<h3 id="___sec115">Governing equations </h3>

<p>
The mathematical model for free thermal convection
consists of the Navier-Stokes equations
coupled to an energy equation governing the temperature:

$$
\begin{align}
\varrho\left(\frac{\partial \u}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla\u\right)
&= -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\u - \varrho g\kk,
\tag{144}\\ 
\nabla\cdot\u & = 0,
\tag{145}\\ 
\varrho c\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla T\right)
&= \kappa\nabla^2 T + 2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}\tp
\tag{146}\\ 
\end{align}
$$

The symbol \( T \) is the temperature, \( c \) is a heat capacity, \( \kappa \)
is the heat conduction coefficient for the fluid. In free convection,
the gravity term \( -g\kk \) is essential since the flow is driven
by temperature differences and the fact that hot fluid rises while
cold fluid falls.

<h3 id="___sec116">Heating by viscous effects </h3>

<p>
We have also included heating of the fluid due to viscous forces
through the term \( 2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij} \), where
\( \varepsilon_{ij} \) is the strain-rate tensor in the flow, defined by

$$ \varepsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}
+ \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right) = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\u + (\nabla\u)^T),$$

where \( u_i \) is the velocity in direction of \( x_i \) (\( i=1,2,3 \) measures the
space directions). The term \( 2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij} \)
is written with Einstein's summation convention in mind such that
there is an implicit sum over \( i \) and \( j \).
This term is also relevant
for forced convection, but was left out in the section <a href="#scale:fluid:forced_convection">Free convection</a> for mathematical simplicity.
However, heating by the work of is often a very
small effect and can be neglected, although it plays a major role in
forging and extrusion of metals. By making the temperature equation
dimensionless, we will get a precise measure when the term can be
neglected.

<h3 id="___sec117">Relation between density and temperature </h3>

<p>
The equations <a href="#mjx-eqn-144">(144)</a> and
<a href="#mjx-eqn-145">(145)</a> has already been made dimensionless
in the previous section. The major difference is now that \( \varrho \)
is no longer a constant, but a function of \( T \).
The relationship between \( \varrho \) and \( T \) is often taken as
linear,

$$ \varrho = \varrho_0 -\varrho_0 \beta (T-T_0),$$

where

$$ \beta = -\frac{1}{\varrho}\left(\frac{\partial\varrho}{\partial t}
\right)_p,$$

is known as the thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid,
and \( \varrho_0 \) a reference density when the temperature is at \( T_0 \).

<h3 id="___sec118">Comment on the form of the equation of continuity </h3>

<p>
It might look strange that the equation of continuity (from the mass
conservation principle) is \( \nabla\cdot\u =0 \)
when there are density variations in the flow. The rationale for using
this version of the continuity equation is the assumption that
the density of each fluid particle remains constant. Consequently,
from the general equation of continuity,

$$ \frac{\partial\varrho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot (\varrho \u) =
\frac{D\varrho}{dt} + \varrho \nabla\cdot\u = 0,$$

it follows that if \( \varrho \) is constant for a particle,
the material derivative \( D\varrho/dt = \varrho_{t} + \v\cdot\nabla\varrho = 0 \),
and the equation reduces to \( \nabla\cdot\u = 0 \).

<h3 id="___sec119">The Boussinesq approximation </h3>

<p>
A very common approximation, called the <em>Boussinesq approximation</em>, is
to neglect the density variations in all terms except the gravity term.
This is a good approximation unless the change is \( \varrho \) is large.
With the linear \( \varrho(T) \) formula and the Boussinesq approximation,
<a href="#mjx-eqn-144">(144)</a>-<a href="#mjx-eqn-146">(146)</a>
take the form

$$
\begin{align}
\varrho_0\left(\frac{\partial \u}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla\u\right)
&= -\nabla p + \mu\nabla^2\u - (\varrho_0 - \varrho_0\beta(T-T_0))g\kk,
\tag{147}\\ 
\nabla\cdot\u & = 0,
\tag{148}\\ 
\varrho_0 c\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \u\cdot\nabla T\right)
&= \kappa\nabla^2 T + 2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}\tp
\tag{149}\\ 
\end{align}
$$

A good justification of the Boussinesq approximation is provided
by Tritton <a href="._scaling-book-solarized011.html#Tritton">[8]</a> (Ch. 13).

<h3 id="___sec120">Scaling </h3>

<p>
Dimensionless variables are introduced as

$$ \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\ \ t_c = \frac{L}{U},\ 
\bar\u = \frac{\u}{U},\ \bar p = \frac{p}{\varrho U^2},\ 
\bar T = \frac{T-T_0}{\Delta T}\tp$$

The dimensionless \( y \) and \( z \) coordinates also make use of \( L \) as scale.
As in forced convection, we assume the characteristic temperature
level \( T_0 \) and the scale \( \Delta T \) is given by thermal boundary and/or
initial conditions.
Contrary to the sections <a href="#sec:scale:ns">The Navier-Stokes equations</a> and <a href="#scale:fluid:forced_convection">Free convection</a>,
\( U \) is now not given by the problem description, but implied by
\( \Delta T \).

<p>
Replacing quantities with dimensions by their dimensionless counterparts
results in

$$
\begin{align*}
\varrho_0\frac{U^2}{L}\frac{\partial \bar\u}{\partial \bar t} +
\varrho_0\frac{U^2}{L}\bar \u\cdot\bar \nabla\bar\u
&= -\frac{p_c}{L}\bar\nabla \bar p + \frac{\mu U}{L^2}
\bar \nabla^2\bar \u - \varrho_0g\kk + \varrho_0\beta T_c\bar T g\kk,
\\ 
\frac{U}{L}\bar\nabla\cdot\bar\u & = 0,
\\ 
\varrho_0 c\left(\frac{T_c U}{L}
\frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar t} +
\frac{UT_c}{L}\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla \bar T\right)
&= \frac{\kappa T_c}{L^2}
\bar \nabla^2 \bar T + 2\frac{\mu U}{L}
\bar\varepsilon_{ij}\bar\varepsilon_{ij}\tp
\end{align*}
$$

These equations reduce to

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \bar\u}{\partial \bar t} +
\bar \u\cdot\bar \nabla\bar\u
&= -\bar\nabla \bar p + \hbox{Re}^{-1}\bar \nabla^2\bar \u
- \hbox{Fr}^{-2}\kk  + \gamma \bar T\kk,
\tag{150}\\ 
\bar\nabla\cdot\bar\u & = 0,
\tag{151}\\ 
\frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar t} +
\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla \bar T
&= \hbox{Pe}^{-1}\bar \nabla^2 \bar T + 2\delta
\bar\varepsilon_{ij}\bar\varepsilon_{ij}\tp
\tag{152}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
The dimensionless numbers are given by
$$
\gamma = \frac{g\beta L\Delta T }{U^2},\quad
\hbox{Pe}^{-1} = \frac{\kappa }{\varrho_0 c UL},\quad
\delta = \frac{\mu U}{L\varrho_0 c \Delta T}\tp
$$

The Peclet number is here defined as the ratio of the
convection term for heat \( \varrho_0 c U\Delta T/L \) and the
heat conduction term \( \kappa U/L^2 \).
The \( \gamma \) number measures the ratio of thermal buoyancy and
the convection term:

$$ \gamma = \frac{\varrho_0 g\beta \Delta T }{\varrho_0 U^2/L}
= \frac{g\beta L\Delta T }{U^2}\tp$$

The Pe parameter is the fraction of the convection term
and the thermal diffusion term:

$$ \frac{\varrho_0 c U \Delta T L^{-1}}{\kappa L^{-2}\Delta T}
= \frac{\varrho c UL}{\kappa } = \hbox{Pe}\tp$$

The \( \delta \) parameter is the ratio of the viscous dissipation term
and the convection term:

$$ \delta = \frac{\mu U^2/L^2}{\varrho_0 c U \Delta T/L} =
= \frac{\mu U}{L\varrho_0 c \Delta T}\tp
$$

<h2 id="___sec121">The Grashof, Prandtl, and Eckert numbers </h2>

<p>
The problem with the above dimensionless numbers is that they involve
\( U \), but \( U \) is implied by \( \Delta T \). Assuming that the convection
term is much bigger than the viscous diffusion term, the momentum
equation features a balance between the buoyancy term and the convection
term:

$$ |\varrho_0 \u\cdot\nabla\u| \sim \varrho_0 g \beta\Delta T\tp$$

Translating this similarity to scales,

$$ \varrho_0 U^2/L \sim \varrho_0 g \beta\Delta T,$$

gives an \( U \) of in terms of \( \Delta T \) :

$$ U = \sqrt{\beta L \Delta T}\tp$$

The Reynolds number with this \( U \) now becomes

$$ \hbox{Re}_T = \frac{UL}{\nu} = \frac{\sqrt{g\beta L^3 \Delta T}}{\nu^2}
= \hbox{Gr}^{1/2},$$

where Gr is the Grashof number in free thermal convection:

$$ \hbox{Ga} = \hbox{Re}_T^2 =  \frac{g\beta L^3 \Delta T}{\nu^2}\tp$$

The Grashof number replaces the Reynolds number in the scaled equations
of free thermal convection. We shall soon look at its interpretations,
which are not as straightforward as for the Reynolds and Peclet numbers.

<p>
The above
choice of \( U \) in terms of \( \Delta T \) results in \( \gamma \) equal to unity:

$$ \gamma = \frac{g\beta L\Delta T }{U^2} =
\frac{g\beta L\Delta T }{g\beta L \Delta T} = 1\tp$$

<p>
The Peclet number can also be rewritten as

$$ \hbox{Pe}= \frac{\varrho c UL}{\kappa } = \frac{\mu c}{\kappa}
\frac{\varrho UL}{\mu}
= \hbox{Pr}\hbox{Re}^{-1} = \hbox{Pr}\hbox{Re}_T,$$

where Pr is the Prandtl number, defined as

$$ \hbox{Pr} = \frac{\mu c}{\kappa}\tp$$

<p>
The Prandtl number is the ratio of the momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) and the thermal diffusivity. Actually, analysis show that Pr reflects the ratio of the thickness of the thermal and velocity boundary layers: when \( \hbox{Pr}=1 \), these layers
coincide, while \( \hbox{Pr}\ll 1 \) implies that the thermal layer is much
thicker than the velocity boundary layer, and vice versa for \( \hbox{Pe}\gg 1 \).

<p>
The \( \delta \) parameter is in free convection replaced by a combination
of the Eckert number (Ec) and the Reynolds number. We have that

$$ \hbox{Ec} = \frac{U^2}{c\Delta T} = \delta\hbox{Re}_T,$$

and consequently

$$ \delta = \hbox{Ec}\hbox{Re}_T^{-1}\tp$$

Writing

$$ \hbox{Ec} = \frac{\varrho_0U^2}{\varrho_0c\Delta T},$$

shows that the Eckert number can be interpreted as the ratio of
the kinetic energy of the flow and the thermal energy.

<p>
We use Ga instead of Re in the momentum equations and also instead of
Pe in the energy equation (recall that \( \hbox{Pe} = \hbox{Pr}\hbox{Re}
= \hbox{Pr}\hbox{Re}_T=\hbox{Pr}\hbox{Gr}^{-1/2} \)). The resulting
scaled system becomes

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \bar\u}{\partial \bar t} +
\bar \u\cdot\bar \nabla\bar\u
&= -\bar\nabla \bar p + \hbox{Gr}^{-1/2}\bar \nabla^2\bar \u
- \hbox{Fr}^{-2}\kk  + \bar T \kk,
\tag{153}\\ 
\bar\nabla\cdot\bar\u & = 0,
\tag{154}\\ 
\hbox{Gr}^{1/2}\left(\frac{\partial \bar T}{\partial \bar t} +
\bar\u\cdot\bar\nabla \bar T\right)
&= \hbox{Pr}^{-1}
\bar \nabla^2 \bar T + 2\hbox{Ec}\hbox{Re}_T^{-1}
\bar\varepsilon_{ij}\bar\varepsilon_{ij}\tp
\tag{155}
\end{align}
$$

<p>
We realize that in free convection, the Grashof number plays the same
role as the Reynolds number in the momentum equation. In particular,
it turns out that Gr governs the transition between laminar and
turbulent flow.  For example, the transition to turbulence occurs in
the range \( 10^8 < \hbox{Gr} < 10^9 \) for free convection from vertical
flat plates.  Gr is normally interpreted as a dimensionless number
expressing the ratio of buoyancy forces and viscous forces.

<p>
Recall that the scaling leading to the Grashof number is based on an
estimate of \( U \) from a balance of the convective and the buoyancy
terms. When the viscous term dominates over convection, we need a
different estimate of \( U \), since in this case, the viscous force
balances the buoyancy force:

$$ \mu\nabla^2\u \sim \varrho_0g\beta\Delta T\quad
\Rightarrow\quad \mu U/L^2 \sim \varrho_0g\beta\Delta T,$$

This similarity suggests the scale

$$ U = \frac{g\beta L^2 \Delta T}{\nu}\tp$$

Now,

$$ \frac{|\varrho_0\u\cdot\nabla\u|}{|\mu\nabla^2\u|} = \frac{UL}{\nu}
= \frac{g\beta L^3 \Delta T}{\nu} = \hbox{Gr}\tp$$

The result means that \( \hbox{Gr}^{1/2} \) measures the ratio of convection and
viscous forces when convection dominates, but Gr measures this ratio when
viscous forces dominate.

<h1 id="scale:bidomain">The bidomain model in electrophysiology</h1>

<p>
The mechanical functioning of the heart is crucially dependent on
correct electric signal propagation through the heart tissue.
A widely used mathematical
model for the electric signal propagation is the bidomain equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\chi C_m\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &=
\nabla\cdot( M_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot (M_i\nabla u_e) - \chi I_{\rm{ion}}
- \chi I_{\rm{app}},
\tag{157}\\ 
0 &= \nabla\cdot( M_i\nabla v) + \nabla\cdot ((M_i + M_e)\nabla u_e)\tp
\tag{158}
\end{align}
$$

These PDEs are posed in a spatial domain \( H \) for \( t\in (0, T] \). The boundary
conditions are of Neumann type, and we drop these from the discussion.
The initial condition is typically \( u_e=v=0 \).

<p>
The symbols in these PDEs have the following meaning:
\( u_e \) is the extracellular electric potential,
\( v \) is the transmembrane potential (difference between the extracellular
and intracellular potential),
\( C_m \) is the capacitance of the cell membrane,
\( \chi \) is a membrane area to cell volume ratio,
\( M_i \) is a electric conductivity tensor for the intracellular space,
\( M_e \) is a electric conductivity tensor for the extracellular space,
\( I_{\rm{ion}} \) is the ionic current across the cell membrane, and
\( I_{\rm{app}} \) is an externally applied current.

<p>
The PDE system is driven by \( I_{\rm{ion}} + I_{\rm{app}} \), and models
for these source terms consist of a system of ODEs at each point
in the domain. The simplest relevant ODE system is the FitzHugh-Nagumo

Dimensionless independent variables are introduced by

$$ \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad
\bar y = \frac{y}{L},\quad \bar z = \frac{z}{L},\quad
\bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},$$

where \( L \) is the characteristic length scale, and \( t_c \) is the
characteristic time scale. Dimensionless dependent variables are
expressed as

$$ \bar v = \frac{v-v_r}{v_p-v_r},\quad \bar u = \frac{u_e}{u_c}, \quad \bar w =
\frac{w}{w_c}\tp$$

Here, \( v_r \) is the resting potential, and \( v_p \) is the peak potential.
The scaling of \( v \) ensures \( \bar v\in [0,1] \). We introduce the symbol
\( \Delta v = v_p-v_r \) to save space in the formulas: \( \bar v = (v-v_r)/\Delta v \).
The scale for \( u_e \) is \( u_c \), and \( w_c \) is a scale for \( w \), both to be
determined either from simplicity of the equations or from available analysis of
their magnitudes.

<p>
The variable tensor coefficients \( M_i \) and \( M_e \) depend on the spatial
coordinates and are also scaled:

$$ \bar M_i = \frac{M_i}{M_c},\quad \bar M_e = \frac{M_e}{M_c}\tp$$

For simplicity, we have chosen a common scale \( M_c \), but the two tensors
might employ difference scales. We may typically choose \( M_c \) as a norm of
\( M_i + M_e \), e.g., the maximum value.

<p>
Inserting the dimensionless variables in the equations, we achieve the system

$$
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
$$

<p>
The length scale is given as the size of the domain, in this case the
diameter of the heart. The time scale is less obvious to choose.
The PDEs are of diffusion nature, and the relevant time scale is related
to the time it takes to diffuse the signal. On the other hand, the ODE
system, in general, may feature many different time scales. Which time
scale to choose for \( t_c \) depends on whether one is interested in
fast time scales for some components in the ODE system or in the
(anticipated) slower diffusion scale of the PDEs. For now we choose
the time scale based on diffusion. From previous examples in
the section <a href="._scaling-book-solarized008.html#sec:scale:diffu:homo1D">Homogeneous diffusion equation</a>, we therefore
set the coefficient in front of the diffusion term to unity, here

$$ \frac{t_cM_c}{\chi C_mL^2} = 1\quad\Rightarrow\quad t_c = \frac{\chi C_mL^2}{M_c}\tp$$

A natural dimensionless variable then arises from the second diffusion
term:

$$ \alpha = \frac{u_c}{\Delta v}\tp$$

The choice \( u_c=\Delta v \) will of course remove the need for this dimensionless
variable, but we include the freedom to have \( u_c \) as
some specified characteristic size of \( u_e \).

<p>
The final dimensionless system becomes

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \bar v}{\partial \bar t} &=
\nabla\cdot( \bar M_i\bar\nabla\bar v) +
\alpha\nabla\cdot (\bar M_i\bar \nabla \bar u) -\\ 
&\quad
\beta
\bar v
(J_1 +  \bar v)
(\bar v - 1) - \gamma\bar w - \delta,
\\ 
0 &= \bar \nabla\cdot( \bar M_i\bar \nabla \bar v) +
\alpha\nabla\cdot ((\bar M_i + \bar M_e)\bar \nabla \bar u),\\ 
\frac{d\bar v}{d\bar t} & = -

(J_1 +  \bar v)
(\bar v -1)- \gamma\bar w - \delta,
\\ 
\frac{d\bar w}{d\bar t} &= -K_1\bar w +
K_2\bar v + K_3\tp
\end{align}
$$

There are eight dimensionless variables in the above equations:

$$
\begin{align}

<p>
Since \( w \) is just a help variable without any physiological interpretation,
we can choose its scale \( w_c \) freely to simplify the expressions.
For example, we can fit \( w_c \) to make \( K_2=1 \), \( K_3=1 \), or \( \gamma=1 \).

<p>
Some of these dimensionless numbers have straightforward interpretations:
\( \alpha \) is the ratio of the span in the two electric potentials;
\( \delta \) is ratio of the source term and the time-derivative term of \( v \),
or the source term and the diffusion term in \( v \).
The rest have fixed values:
\( J_1 \) and \( J_2 \) have well-established values from measurements,
while \( \beta \), \( \gamma \), \( K_1 \), \( K_2 \), and \( K_3 \) contain empirically
fitted constants with known values, combined with known scales and
other known physical parameters.

Here, \( m \) is the mass of the projectile, \( \x=x\ii + y\jj \) is
the position vector of the projectile, \( \ii \) and \( \jj \)
are unit vectors along the \( x \) and \( y \) axes, respectively,

<h2 id="scale:decay:exer:predpray">Problem 10: Scale a predator-pray model</h2>

<p>
The evolution of animal populations with a predator and a pray (e.g.,
lynx and hares, or foxes and rabbits) can be described by the
Lotka-Volterra ODE system

$$
\begin{align}
H^{\prime} &= H(a - bL),
\tag{162}\\ 
L^{\prime} &= L(dH - c),
\tag{163}\\ 
H(0)&=H_0,\\ 
L(0)&=L_0\tp
\end{align}
$$

Here, \( H \) is the number of animals of the pray (say hares)
and \( L \) is the corresponding measure of the predator population (say lynx).
There are six parameters: \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), \( d \), \( H_0 \), and \( L_0 \).

<p>
The terms has the following meanings:

<ul>
 <li> \( aH \) is the exponential
   population growth of \( H \) due to births and deaths and is governed by
   the access to nutrition,</li>
 <li> \( -bHL \) is the loss of prays because they are eaten by predators,</li>
 <li> \( dHL \) is the increase of prays because they eat predators (but only
   a fraction of the eaten prays, \( bHL \), contribute to population growth
   of the predator and therefore \( d < b \)),</li>
 <li> \( -cL \) is the exponential decay in the predator population because of
   deaths (the increase is modeled by \( dHL \)).</li>
</ul>

Dimensionless independent and dependent variables are introduced as usual
by

$$ \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},\quad
\bar H = \frac{H}{H_c},\quad \bar L = \frac{L}{L_c},
$$

where \( t_c \), \( H_c \), and \( L_c \) are scales to be determined. Inserted
in the ODE problem we arrive at

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{H_0}{t_c}\frac{d\bar H}{d\bar t} &= H_0\bar H(a - bH_0\bar L),
\tag{165}\\ 
\frac{H_0}{t_c}\frac{d\bar L}{d\bar t} &= H_0\bar L(dH_0\bar H - c),
\tag{165}\\ 
H_c\bar H(0) &= H_0,
\tag{166}\\ 
L_c\bar H(0) &= L_0\tp
\tag{167}

$$

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Consider first a simple, intuitive scaling of \( H \) and \( L \) based on
initial conditionsL \( H_c=H_0 \)
and \( L_c=H_c \). This means that \( \bar H \) starts out at unity and \( \bar L \)
starts out as the fraction \( L_0/H_0 \). Find a time scale and identify
dimensionless parameters in the scaled ODE problem.

<p>
<!-- removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

Try a different scaling where the aim is to adjust the scales such that
the ODEs become as simple as possible, i.e, have as few dimensionless
parameters as possible. Compare with the scaling in a).

<!-- removed !bsol ... !esol environment (because of the command-line option --without_solutions)

<p>
<b>c)</b>
A more mathematical approach to determining suitable scales for \( H \) and \( L \)
consists in finding the stationary points \( (H,L) \) of the ODE system,
where \( H^{\prime}=L^{\prime}=0 \), and use such points as characteristic
sizes of the dependent variables. Show that \( H^{\prime}=L^{\prime}=0 \)
implies \( H=L=0 \) or \( L=a/b \) and \( H=c/d \). Use \( H_c=a/b \), \( L_c=c/d \),
and find a time scale. Compare with the result in b).
