Scaling of Differential Equations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

:Authors: Hans Petter Langtangen, Geir K. Pedersen

This book explains the mathematical details of making differential
equation models dimensionless. A key feature of the text is the reasoning
about the right choice
of scales. A large number of worked examples demonstrate
the scaling technique for ordinary and partial differential equations
from physics and biology. How to utilize scaled models in simulation
software is also addressed.
