The convection-diffusion equation
=================================

Convection-diffusion without a force term
-----------------------------------------

.. index:: Peclet number

We now add a convection term :math:`\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla u` to the diffusion
equation to obtain the well-known convection-diffusion equation:

.. _Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:

.. math::

    \tag{165}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla u =
        {\alpha}\nabla^2 u,
        \quad  x,y, z\in \Omega,\ t\in (0, T]{\thinspace .}
        
        

The velocity field :math:`\boldsymbol{v}` is prescribed, and its characteristic size :math:`V`
is normally clear from the problem description.

[**hpl 15**: Drop specification of spatial and temporal domain? Is this basically notational noise when the PDE gets more complicated? Geir says no.]

[**hpl 16**: Show a sketch of a couple of cases, can be the same as Navier-Stokes, where different :math:`V` is obvious.]

Inserting

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{x_c},\ \bar y = \frac{y}{y_c},\ \bar z = \frac{z}{z_c},
        \ \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}, \ \bar\boldsymbol{v} = \frac{\boldsymbol{v}}{V},
        \ \bar u =\frac{u}{u_c}

in :ref:`(165) <Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1>` yields

.. math::
        
        \frac{u_c}{t_c}
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} +
        \frac{u_c V}{L}\bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar u =
        \frac{{\alpha} u_c}{L^2}\bar\nabla^2\bar u,
        \quad \bar x,\bar y,\bar z\in \Omega,\ \bar t\in (0,\bar T]{\thinspace .}
        

For :math:`u_c` we simply introduce the symbol :math:`U`, which we may estimate
from an initial condition. It is not critical here since it vanishes
from the scaled equation anyway as long as there is no source term
present.
With some velocity measure :math:`V` and length measure :math:`L`, it is
tempting to just let :math:`t_c = L/V`. This is the characteristic time it takes to
transport a signal by convection through the domain.
The alternative is to use the
diffusion length scale :math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha}`. Very often in these kind of
problems, the convection term :math:`\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla u` dominates over the
diffusion term :math:`{\alpha}\nabla^2 u`, so the time scale for convection,
which is :math:`L/V`,
is most appropriate of the two. Only when
the diffusion term is very much larger than the convection
term (corresponding to very small Peclet numbers, see below)
we would apply :math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha}`.

The non-dimensional form of the PDE with :math:`t_c=L/V` becomes

.. _Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:d:

.. math::

    \tag{166}
    \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} +
        \bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar u =
        \hbox{Pe}^{-1}\bar\nabla^2\bar u,
        \quad \bar x,\bar y,\bar z\in \Omega,\ \bar t\in (0,\bar T],
        
        

where Pe is the *Peclet number*,

.. math::
         \hbox{Pe} = \frac{LV}{{\alpha}}{\thinspace .}

Estimating the size of the convection term :math:`\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla u` as
:math:`VU/L` and the diffusion term :math:`{\alpha}\nabla^2 u` as :math:`{\alpha} U/L^2`,
we see that the Peclet number measures the ratio of the convection
and the diffusion terms:

.. math::
         \hbox{Pe} = \frac{\hbox{convection}}{\hbox{diffusion}} =
        \frac{VU/L}{{\alpha} U/L^2}= \frac{LV}{{\alpha}}{\thinspace .}
        

In case we use the diffusion time scale
:math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha}`, we get the non-dimensional PDE

.. _Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:d2:

.. math::

    \tag{167}
    \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} +
        \hbox{Pe}\,\bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar u =
        \bar\nabla^2\bar u,
        \quad \bar x,\bar y,\bar z\in \Omega,\ \bar t\in (0,\bar T]{\thinspace .}
        
        


.. admonition:: Discussion of scales and balance of terms in the PDE

   We see that :ref:`(166) <Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:d>` and :ref:`(167) <Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:d2>`
   are not equivalent, and they are based on two different time scales.
   For moderate Peclet numbers around 1, all terms have the same size
   in :ref:`(166) <Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:d>`, i.e., a size around unity.
   For large Peclet numbers,
   :ref:`(166) <Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:d>` expresses a balance
   between the time derivative term and the convection term, both of size
   unity, and then there is a very small term
   :math:`\hbox{Pe}^{-1}\bar\nabla^2\bar u` term because Pe is large and
   :math:`\bar\nabla^2\bar u` should be of size unity.
   That the convection term dominates over the diffusion term is
   consistent with the time scale :math:`t_c=L/V` based on convection transport.
   In this case, we can neglect the diffusion term as Pe goes to infinity
   and work with a pure convection (or advection) equation
   
   .. math::
           
           \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} +
           \bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar u = 0{\thinspace .}
           
   
   For small Peclet numbers, :math:`\hbox{Pe}^{-1}\bar\nabla^2\bar u` becomes
   very large and can only be balanced by two terms that are supposed to
   be unity of size.  The time-derivative and/or the convection term must
   be much larger than unity, but that means we use suboptimal scales,
   since right scales imply that :math:`\partial\bar u/\partial\bar t` and
   :math:`\bar v\cdot\bar\nabla\bar u` of order unity. Switching to a time
   scale based on diffusion as the dominating physical effect gives
   :ref:`(167) <Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:d2>`.  For very small Peclet numbers this
   equation tells that the time-derivative balances the diffusion, while
   the convection :math:`\bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar\boldsymbol{u}` is around
   unity, but multiplied by a very small coefficient Pe, so this term is
   negligible in the PDE. An approximate PDE for small Peclet numbers is
   therefore
   
   .. math::
           
           \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t}
           = \bar\nabla^2\bar u{\thinspace .}
           
   
   Scaling can with the above type of reasoning be used
   to neglect terms from a differential equation under precise mathematical
   conditions.




Stationary PDE
--------------

Suppose the problem is stationary and that there is no need for
any time scale. How is this type of convection-diffusion problem
scaled? We get

.. math::
        
        \frac{VU}{L}\bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar u =
        \frac{{\alpha} U}{L^2}\bar\nabla^2\bar u,
        

or

.. _Eq:scale:convdiff:pde1:d3:

.. math::

    \tag{168}
    \bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar u =
        \hbox{Pe}^{-1}\bar\nabla^2\bar u{\thinspace .}
        
        

This scaling only "works" for moderate Peclet numbers. For very small or
very large Pe, either the convection term :math:`\bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla\bar u`
or the diffusion term :math:`\bar\nabla^2\bar u` must deviate significantly
from unity.

Consider the following 1D example to illustrate the point: :math:`\boldsymbol{v} = v\boldsymbol{i}`,
:math:`v>0` constant, a domain :math:`[0,L]`, with boundary conditions :math:`u(0)=0` and
:math:`u(L)=U_L`. (The vector :math:`\boldsymbol{i}` is a unit vector in :math:`x` direction.)
The problem with dimensions is now

.. math::
         vu^{\prime} = {\alpha} u^{\prime\prime},\quad u(0)=0,\ u(L)=U_L{\thinspace .}

Scaling results in

.. math::
         \frac{d\bar u}{d\bar x} = \hbox{Pe}^{-1}\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar x^2},\quad
        \bar x\in (0,1),\quad \bar u(0)=0,\ \bar u(1) = 1,

if we choose :math:`U=U_L`. The solution of the scaled problem is

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar x) = \frac{1 - e^{\bar x\hbox{Pe}}}{1 - e^{\hbox{Pe}}}{\thinspace .}

Figure :ref:`scale:convdiff:fig:scaled` indicates how :math:`\bar u` depends on
Pe: small Pe values give approximately a straight line while large Pe
values lead to a *boundary layer* close to :math:`x=1`, where the solution
changes very rapidly.

.. _scale:convdiff:fig:scaled:

   *Solution of scaled problem for 1D convection-diffusion*

We realize that for large Pe,

.. math::
         \max_{\bar x}\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar x} \approx \hbox{Pe},\quad
        \max_{\bar x}\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar x^2} \approx \hbox{Pe}^{2},

which are consistent results with the PDE since the double derivative term
is multiplied by :math:`\hbox{Pe}^{-1}`.
For small Pe,

.. math::
         \max_{\bar x}\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar x}     \approx 1,\quad
           \max_{\bar x}\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar x^2} \approx 0,

which is also consistent with the PDE
since an almost vanishing second-order derivative
is multiplied by a very large coefficient :math:`\hbox{Pe}^{-1}`.
However, we have a problem with very large
derivatives of :math:`\bar u` when Pe is large.

To arrive at a proper scaling for large Peclet numbers,
we need to remove the Pe coefficient
from the differential equation. There are only two scales at our
disposals: :math:`u_c` and :math:`x_c` for :math:`u` and :math:`x`, respectively.
The natural value for :math:`u_c` is the boundary value :math:`U_L` at :math:`x=L`.
The scaling of :math:`Vu_x = {\alpha} u_{xx}` then results in

.. math::
         \frac{d\bar u}{d\bar x} = \frac{{\alpha}}{Vx_c}\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar x^2},
        \quad \bar x\in (0,\bar L),\quad \bar u(0)=0,\ \bar u(\bar L)=1,

where :math:`\bar L = L/x_c`. Choosing the coefficient :math:`{\alpha}/(Vx_c)` to
be unity results in the scale :math:`x_c={\alpha}/V`, and :math:`\bar L` becomes Pe.
The final, scaled boundary-value
problem is now

.. math::
         \frac{d\bar u}{d\bar x} = \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar x^2},
        \quad \bar x \in (0, \hbox{Pe}), \quad \bar u(0)=0,\ \bar u(\hbox{Pe})=1,

with solution

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar x) = \frac{1 - e^{\bar x}}{1 - e^{\small\mbox{Pe}}}{\thinspace .}

Figure :ref:`scale:convdiff:fig:rescaled` displays :math:`\bar u` for some
Peclet numbers, and we see that the shape of the graphs are the same
with this scaling. For large Peclet numbers we realize that :math:`\bar u`
and its derivatives are around unity
(:math:`1-e^{\hbox{Pe}}\approx -e^{\small\hbox{Pe}}`),
but for small Peclet numbers :math:`d\bar u/d\bar x \sim \hbox{Pe}^{-1}`.

   *Solution of scaled problem where the length scale depends on the Peclet number*

The conclusion is that for small Peclet numbers, :math:`x_c=L` is an
appropriate length scale.
The scaled equation :math:`\hbox{Pe}\,\bar u' = \bar u''` indicates that :math:`\bar
u''\approx 0`, and the solution is close to a straight line.  For
large Pe values, :math:`x_c={\alpha}/V` is an appropriate length scale, and the
scaled equation :math:`\bar u' = \bar u''`
expresses that the terms :math:`\bar u'` and :math:`\bar u''` are
equal and of size around unity.

Convection-diffusion with a force term
--------------------------------------

Let us add a force term :math:`f(\boldsymbol{x},t)` to the convection-diffusion equation :

.. _Eq:scale:convdiff:pde2:

.. math::

    \tag{169}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{v}\cdot\nabla u =
        {\alpha}\nabla^2 u + f{\thinspace .}
        
        

The scaled version reads

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{t_cV}{L}\bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar\nabla \bar u =
        \frac{t_c{\alpha}}{L^2}\bar\nabla^2 \bar u + \frac{t_cf_c}{u_c}\bar f{\thinspace .}
        

We can base :math:`t_c` on convective transport: :math:`t_c = L/V`. Now,
:math:`u_c` could be chosen to make the coefficient in the source term unity:
:math:`u_c = t_cf_c = Lf_c/V`.
This leaves us with

.. math::
         \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar \nabla\bar u =
        \hbox{Pe}^{-1}\bar \nabla^2 \bar u + \bar f{\thinspace .}
        

In the diffusion limit, we base :math:`t_c` on the diffusion time scale:
:math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha}`, and the coefficient of the source term set to unity
determines :math:`u_c` according to

.. math::
         \frac{L^2 f_c}{{\alpha} u_c} = 1\quad\Rightarrow\quad u_c = \frac{L^2 f_c}{{\alpha}}{\thinspace .}

The corresponding PDE reads

.. math::
         \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \hbox{Pe}\,\bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar \nabla\bar u =
        \bar\nabla^2 \bar u + \bar f,
        

so for small Peclet numbers, which we have, the convective term can
be neglected and we get a pure diffusion equation with a source term.

What if the problem is stationary?
Then there is no time scale and we get

.. math::
        
        \frac{V u_c}{L}\bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar \nabla \bar u =
        \frac{u_c {\alpha}}{L^2}\bar\nabla^2 \bar u + f_c\bar f,
        

or

.. math::
        
        \bar\boldsymbol{v}\cdot\bar \nabla \bar u =
        \hbox{Pe}^{-1}\bar\nabla^2 \bar u + \frac{f_c L}{V u_c}\bar f,
        

Again, choosing :math:`u_c` such that the source term coefficient is unity leads
to :math:`u_c= f_c L/V`.
Alternatively, :math:`u_c` can be based on the initial condition, with similar
results as found in the sections on the wave and diffusion PDEs.
