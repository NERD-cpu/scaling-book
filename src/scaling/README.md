## Examples

This directory contains program examples for the book *Scaling of
Differential Equations*.

**Note**: The programs here are copied from the original source in the
`doc/.src/src-scaling` directory (correct files in that directory
and recompile the book by `make.sh` to update the present directory
with new program files).
